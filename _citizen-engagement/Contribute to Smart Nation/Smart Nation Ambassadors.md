## Transform Lives with Technology

![Smart Nation Ambassdors](/images/community/sna/smartnationambassador02.jpeg)

Are you interested to help others understand and use tech for better work, life and play? Volunteer as a Smart Nation Ambassador for many opportunities to do just that!

### Meet our Smart Nation Ambassadors

Since the Smart Nation Ambassadors (SNAs) programme was launched in January 2019, more than 4,700[^1] volunteers have joined us to help the community embrace digital technologies.

Our Ambassadors are the ‘special sauce’ that make Smart Nation tick. From poly students to retirees, from academics to techies – they are bound by a desire to bring their skills, expertise and experience to add to our Smart Nation effort. Their contributions can take many different shapes, be it sharing user tips on digital government tools and services at roadshows, facilitating webinars on everyday apps, or helping project teams gather user feedback on on-going or upcoming digital products and services.

Every year, we host an event to thank our wonderful Ambassadors, and also give special mention to the Star SNAs for being our super volunteers. Find out what motivates them in the videos below:
