Smart Nation PlayScape is jointly led by the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) and [Science Centre Singapore](https://www.science.edu.sg/). It was developed with ideas, feedback and contributions from more than 200 members of the community, including students, private companies and members of the public.

This exhibition is suitable for everyone, aged 10 and above. It features a wide variety of digital technologies powering Singapore’s Smart Nation journey. By using gamified interactive elements, this exhibition brings
technological concepts to life and further simplifies them for better public
understanding.

Visitors are invited to explore the endless possibilities of technology through the immersive exhibits in eight zones:

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Data Analytics
* Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR)
* Biometrics &amp; Cybersecurity
* Blockchain
* Geospatial
* Robotics
* Sensors
* User Experience (UX)
