Want to check if your TraceTogether Token is working? Head over to our Token checking pods to find out.

## What Are Token Checking Pods?

These TraceTogether Token checking pods are equipped with a SafeEntry Gateway device for you to check if your Token is working.

If your Token is working, there will be a green light and a beep sound when the Token is brought near the SafeEntry Gateway device. If your Token is faulty or is out of battery, there will be no light and no beep.

To replace your Token, do visit token.gowhere.gov.sg for the list of replacement booths at CCs and malls, as well as locations of the TraceTogether Token vending machines.
