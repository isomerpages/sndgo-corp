## About Jurong Lake District

[Jurong Lake District](https://www.jld.gov.sg/) is a 410ha new growth area in western Singapore. It&nbsp; is the largest mixed-use business district outside Singapore’s city centre, and is developed to support our decentralisation efforts and to grow our economy. It is envisioned to&nbsp;be a model district that promotes urban sustainability and a healthy living environment for residents, workers, and visitors.

Jurong Lake District aims to achieve net zero emissions for new developments around 2045. This is part of [Singapore's national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/press-releases/singapore-commits-to-achieve-net-zero/).

## About the Jurong Lake District Innovation challenge

To realise our sustainability ambition, we must work with relevant stakeholders such as landlords, businesses, residents, and urban solution providers to innovate and experiment with new ideas and solutions to shape our collective, sustainable future.

We are calling for all start-ups, companies, institutes of higher learning, and research institutes to propose novel solutions to address the sustainability challenges facing the district.

Our partners in Jurong Lake District have come together to share their challenge statements, under the key themes below:

Reducing the carbon footprint of the district will be a combined effort by residents, businesses and visitors; and should be made fun, educational and hassle-free.<br><br><a href="/jldchallenge2023/#low-carbon">Challenge Statements</a></div>

We are seeking to implement a mix of strategies from infrastructural enhancements to behavioural nudges to make car-lite an integral part of everyone’s lifestyle choices in Jurong Lake District.<br><br><a href="/jldchallenge2023/#car-lite">Challenge Statements</a></div>
