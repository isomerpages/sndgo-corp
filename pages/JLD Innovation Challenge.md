![Jurong Lake District](/images/JLD/Jurong%20Lake%20District.jpeg)

## About JLD

[Jurong Lake District (JLD)](https://www.jld.gov.sg/) is a 410ha new growth area in western Singapore and is planned to be the largest mixed-use business district outside the city centre to support our decentralisation efforts and to grow our economy. It will be a model district that promotes urban sustainability and a healthy living environment for residents, workers, and visitors.  
  
Jurong Lake District aims to achieve net zero emissions for new developments around 2045. This is part of [Singapore's national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/press-releases/singapore-commits-to-achieve-net-zero/). 

## About the JLD Innovation challenge

To realise our sustainability ambition, we believe in collaborating with relevant stakeholders in the district such as landlords, businesses, residents, and urban solution providers, and experimenting with new ideas and novel solutions to collectively shape a sustainable future.

We are calling for all start-ups, private companies, institutes of higher learning, and research institutes to propose innovative solutions to address the sustainability challenges facing the district.

Our partners from Jurong Lake District have come together to share their challenge statements, under the key themes below:

<img src="/images/JLD/JLD-Low-Carbon.jpg" alt="Low Carbon"><br><div class="header"><b>Low Carbon</b></div><br><br>All new buildings in Jurong Lake District will be required to minimally achieve Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy) certification. Existing businesses are also actively seeking ways to reduce energy consumption in their buildings. Reducing the carbon footprint of the district will be a combined effort by residents, businesses and visitors; and should be made fun, educational and hassle-free.

More can be done to increase recycling rates by strengthening the effectiveness of strategies through the help of digitalisation.

<img src="/images/JLD/JLD-Car-Lite.jpg" alt="Car-lite"><br><div class="header"><b>Car-lite</b></div><br><br>Today, getting to Jurong Lake District is convenient using the established public transport network. By the 2030s, Jurong Lake District will be even more connected with four MRT lines serving it and at least 85% of all trips targeted to be made by Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport in 2035. We are seeking to implement a mix of strategies from infrastructural enhancements to behavioural nudges to make car-lite an integral part of everyone’s lifestyle choices in Jurong Lake District.

In the long run, it could also reduce reliance on manpower for repetitive tasks and enhance the well-being of employees.
