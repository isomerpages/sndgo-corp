# Digital Economy

A Digital Economy takes advantage of the latest technology to digitalise processes and drive business growth. This attracts foreign investments which, in turn, creates new jobs and opportunities for those in Singapore.

### Digital Economy Framework for Action

Singapore’s pro-business environment, excellent tech infrastructure, close connectivity to major Asian economies as well as the availability of investment puts us in a good position to develop a strong Digital Economy.

Three key strategies have been identified in the <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/About-IMDA/infocomm-media-landscape/SGDigital/Digital-Economy-Framework-for-Action">Digital Economy Framework for Action</a> to take advantage of our strengths:
* Accelerate our economic growth by digitalising industries and businesses
* Develop an ecosystem to help businesses stay vibrant and competitive
* Transform the Infocomm Media  industry to be a key growth driver of the Digital Economy

### Digital Enterprise Blueprint

The digital landscape is evolving at an unprecedented rate and this rapid transformation provides limitless opportunities for all. Our enterprises have made good progress on digitalisation, but we need to stay ahead of the curve in ensuring that our enterprises remain competitive and our workers continue to enjoy good jobs.

The&nbsp;[Digital Enterprise Blueprint](https://www.mci.gov.sg/digital-enterprise-blueprint/), co-created with key ecosystem stakeholders, sets out our ambition for the next bound of digitalisation and aims to establish Singapore as a nation of empowered enterprises and workers. We have identified&nbsp;four focus areas&nbsp;to help us achieve this:

* Empower enterprises to be smarter by adopting AI-enabled solutions,

* Enable enterprises to scale faster through integrated digital solutions,

* Equip enterprises to be safer through improved cyber resilience, and

* Upskill Workers to make full use of digital capabilities.
