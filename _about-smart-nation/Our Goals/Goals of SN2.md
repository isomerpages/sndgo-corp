# Goals of Smart Nation 2.0

Smart Nation 2.0 seeks to achieve three key goals: Trust, Growth, and Community.&nbsp;These goals shape how technology is used to improve citizensâ€™ lives and create a thriving digital future for all. They also reflect key areas of feedback and concern that citizens have raised over the years, gathered through surveys, research, and other feedback channels.
