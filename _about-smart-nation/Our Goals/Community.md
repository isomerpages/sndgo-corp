# A Smart Nation that Keeps us Together

![Community](/images/Goals/sncommunity01.jpg)

Our efforts to build a trusted digital environment with growing opportunities for Singaporeans help to shape a more united and cohesive Singapore. We will ensure that our Smart Nation benefits and uplifts all segments of society.

The features of the Singapore we hold dear – our shared values and aspirations, our care for the people around us, and our sense of togetherness&nbsp;– must be maintained and strengthened in our Smart Nation.

To build a Smart Nation that keeps us together, we will:

### Strengthen inclusion: leaving no one behind

Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives and benefit from digital technologies, whether it enables them to better communicate with friends and family, access essential services or enjoy recreational activities.

Digital divides — where gaps in digital access and skills fuel social and economic inequalities —&nbsp;should not be allowed to persist. There has been&nbsp;good progress over the years in enhancing digital access for all, and we will continue to identify and address gaps in this area.

Our outreach efforts and partnerships will be strengthened to reach more Singaporeans, so that everyone can learn digital skills with confidence.&nbsp;Our digital products will be made more accessible and inclusive for all users, through co-creation with private sector and community partners.

### Strengthen the unity of our community

Technology can help bridge the gap between Singaporeans from different walks of life, by deepening mutual understanding and strengthening our shared identity and culture.

But it can also derail our sense of community. Countries all over the world are grappling with digital developments that undermine cohesion, such as the formation of echo chambers and increasingly divisive debates.

Singaporeans need to work together to nurture a positive, civic-minded culture online&nbsp;— where digital technology is used to uplift, unify and strengthen our society.

### Strengthen partnerships with citizens

Smart Nation is ultimately a whole-of-nation effort. Citizens will be engaged to create meaningful change and play their part to shape the next chapter of Singapore’s story, through digital technology.

We will provide channels for citizens to share feedback, co-create ideas, and grow a community where everyone is empowered to design and build digital solutions to tackle pressing community needs.
