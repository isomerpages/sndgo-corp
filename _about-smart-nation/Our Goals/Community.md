# A Smart Nation that Keeps us Together

![Community](/images/Goals/sncommunity01.jpg)

A trusted digital environment and growing opportunities for Singaporeans help to shape a stronger, more united, and cohesive Singapore.

As we navigate the digital age, we must ensure that our Smart Nation benefits and uplifts all segments of society.&nbsp;Our shared values and aspirations must be maintained, our care for the people around us must be deepened, and our sense of togetherness&nbsp;must be preserved. These are the features of the Singapore we hold dear, and they must be strengthened in our Smart Nation.

**To build a Smart Nation that keeps us together, we will:**

### Strengthen inclusion: leaving no one behind

Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives and benefit from digital technologies: whether it enables them to better communicate with friends and family, access essential services or enjoy recreational activities.

Digital divides — where gaps in digital access and skills fuel social and economic inequalities —&nbsp;&nbsp;should not be allowed to persist.&nbsp; There has been&nbsp;good progress over the years in enhancing digital access for all and we will continue to identify and address gaps in this area.

Our outreach efforts and partnerships to reach more Singaporeans will be strengthened so we can all learn digital skills with confidence.&nbsp;Digital products will be made more accessible and inclusive with strengthened usability, both within the Government and in partnership with the private sector.

### Strengthen the unity of our community

Technology can help bridge the gap between Singaporeans from different walks of life, by deepening mutual understanding and strengthening our shared identity and culture.

But it can also derail our sense of community. Countries all over the world are grappling with digital developments that undermine cohesion, such as the formation of echo chambers and increasingly divisive debates.

Singaporeans need to work together to nurture a positive, civic-minded culture online&nbsp;— one where digital technology brings us together and strengthens our society.

### Strengthen partnerships with citizens

Smart Nation is ultimately a whole-of-nation effort. Citizens will be engaged to create meaningful change and play their part to shape the next chapter of Singapore’s story, through digital technology.

We will provide channels for citizens to share feedback, co-create ideas, and grow a community where everyone is empowered to design and build digital solutions to tackle pressing community needs.
