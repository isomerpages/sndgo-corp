Our vision of a Digital Government is “digital to the core, and serves with heart”. Digitalisation is an effective means for the Government to serve citizens with greater empathy, through designing policies and services that are inclusive, seamless and personalised for all.

The [Digital Government Blueprint (277kb)](/files/publications/dgb-public-document_30dec20.pdf) outlines 15 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure our Government’s digitalisation progress. Some of these KPIs, targeted for completion by 2023, include:

*   70% of eligible Government systems to be hosted on commercial cloud platforms
*   90-95% of transactions to be completed digitally from end-to-end
*   100% of services to be pre-filled with Government-verified data
*   Data sharing for cross-agency projects should be completed in no more than 7 working days
*   All public officers to have basic digital literacy skills

New policies and initiatives are continually being added to the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) to help us chart the fast-changing tides of tech and world events. 

## The progress so far
Regularly reviewing KPIs allows us to assess our performance and identify areas for improvement. As of the end of 2023, here are some key statistics:

* **Citizen Satisfaction with Government Digital Services** <br>*(Percentage that rated 5 &amp; above)*

  * All 20 ministries have submitted plans to use artificial intelligence, meeting the target of broadening digitalisation within the Government.
