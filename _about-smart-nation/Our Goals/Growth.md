# A Smart Nation that Helps Us Grow

![Growth](/images/community/playscape/playscape_23.jpeg)

Digitalisation has been a significant contributor to Singapore’s economic and wage growth and can create new opportunities for our people.

With technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), the boundaries of productivity can be pushed further and the competitiveness of our industries can be strengthened.

In the realm of research, new technologies can help expand the limits of human discovery. But technological advances may also cause unwelcome disruption to the economy and labour markets. We will make every effort to help our workers and enterprises adapt, while developing technology to enhance our capabilities.

It is important to prepare our people to thrive with technology in a future markedly different from today, so each successive generation can navigate an increasingly digital world and live fuller and richer lives.

**To build a Smart Nation that helps us grow, we will:**

### Power our digital economy

Robust, resilient and future-ready digital infrastructure is the foundation for a strong digital economy to grow. It enables reliable internet connectivity and high-speed data transfer that supports a full range of economic and social activities. We will anticipate needs, stay ahead of trends, and continue to upgrade our digital infrastructure to preserve Singapore’s leading position.

AI is a strategic national priority. As the AI ecosystem in Singapore grows more vibrant by the day, adoption of AI in public service delivery is increasing, and we are building on this momentum to spur innovation across multiple sectors, while minimising the risks that AI brings.

### Empower our enterprises and workers

Growth and progress will be shared widely with our workers and enterprises. Technology should enhance our people’s capabilities regardless of their starting points and circumstances.

Enterprises will be empowered to take full advantage of technology to raise productivity, transform, and serve customers better, while workers will be enabled to adapt, succeed, and realise their aspirations in a changing economy.

### Prepare our next generation

Our next generation will be equipped to expand their horizons and realise their aspirations in a digital future. This goes beyond preparing them for work in a digital economy – our children need to be equipped for life in the digital age.

We want young Singaporeans to be curious, confident, and creative users of technology. Our children must learn to use technology to enhance their capabilities, and to apply it in an ethical and responsible manner. There will be enhanced programmes, increased resources for schools, and strengthened support for educators to design effective learning experiences that develop students’ digital proficiency.
