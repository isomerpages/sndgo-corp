## Enabling a Culture of Innovation and Experimentation

Our innovation and growth are rooted in our people and culture. For our Smart Nation initiative to succeed, we need the right policies and legislations, as well as support for research and co-creation from both the public and private sectors. 

You can read about the initiatives we have to facilitate this culture of innovation below.

* **Open Data** - Data sets collected by public agencies are now available and accessible to the public through online portals, making it easy for developers to co-create digital solutions to benefit society. 

* **Living Laboratory** - 
Research and innovation initiatives such as <a href="https://www.nrf.gov.sg/about-nrf/rie-ecosystem" target="_blank">Research, Innovation and Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://www.aisingapore.org/" target="_blank">AI Singapore</a> allow us to leverage emerging tech breakthroughs to drive our Smart Nation goals. Our Digital Economy is also an attractive hotbed for companies and researchers to develop, prototype and pilot their technological solutions.

* **Industry and Start-up Ecosystem** - Singaporeâ€™s start-up ecosystem thrives due to its robust network of venture capitalists, multinational corporations (MNCs), and start-up accelerators such as&nbsp;[SGInnovate](https://www.sginnovate.com/). Initiatives like&nbsp;[LaunchPad](https://www.jtc.gov.sg/find-land/land-for-long-term-development/launchpad)&nbsp;provide an ideal environment for startups and entrepreneurs to collaborate, innovate, and scale their businesses by offering a comprehensive range of tailored resources and facilities. 

* **Cybersecurity and Data Privacy** - Cybersecurity helps us safeguard our Smart Nation growth by keeping critical systems and networks secure. We have our eye on possible risks and prioritise data privacy at all times.

* **Computational Capabilities and Digital Inclusion** - Basic coding and computational thinking skills will help everyone benefit from our Smart Nation growth, regardless of age or digital literacy. We currently offer resources to assist both [individuals](/community/opportunities) and [businesses](/resources/business) to re-skill, so that they can leverage the growing opportunities of our Digital Economy.
 
* **Cross-border Collaboration** - One way for us to grow is through sharing good ideas and best practices, exploring collaborations, and testing people-centric smart solutions within the region. The <a href="https://asean.org/asean/asean-smart-cities-network/" target="_blank">ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN)</a> was established in 2018, offering a platform for ASEAN cities to exchange ideas and solutions to catalyse smart city projects.
