## 2021

### Singapore come up tops for digital inclusiveness!

Singapore ranked first among 82 countries in [Roland Berger's](https://www.rolandberger.com/en/) Digital Inclusion Index.

Singapore was lauded for its inclusive measures such as free public WiFi and financial assistance schemes for digital skills training, which have been credited with supporting wider digital adoption, and narrowing the digital divide.

### Singapore climbed to the top of the Smart City Governments Ranking

Singapore eclipsed London to take top spot in a biennial study by [Eden Strategy Institute](https://www.edenstrategyinstitute.com/) that ranks the top 50 smart city governments in the world. 

Singapore took the honours due to factors such as its technology infrastructure, digital initiatives and its “sterling” response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Seoul and London took the 2nd and 3rd spots respectively with the third Asian city – Shanghai – in the 8th spot.

### Singapore ranked first in KPMG's Global Ranking of Leading Technology Hubs

Still hustlin', still innovating. For the second year running, Singapore has clinched the top spot in KPMG's global ranking of leading technology innovation hubs outside of Silicon Valley/San Francisco.

Ling Su Min, Partner, Head of Clients, Markets & Innovation, KPMG in Singapore said, “Singapore's accomplishments as a leading tech innovation hub have been part of the country's strategic vision. It reinforces other strengths that the nation has consciously built up, such as a reputable global financial hub and a critical gateway for businesses to access the rest of Asia. The recognition that we are only stronger if competitive on multiple fronts in today’s digitally connected global economy, has fostered greater collaboration and convergence between sectors, industries and previously dispersed ecosystems. These attributes continue to draw top talent to live, work and play in this city in a garden (Singapore), as we work together for a better and greener future.”

## 2020

### Singapore topped the IMD-SUTD Smart City Index for 2nd Year Running

Singapore has topped the IMD-SUTD Smart City Index again for 2020. The Index is based on citizens' perception of how their city's technological advances have impacted their lives. 

For 2020, Institute for Management Development (IMD) surveyed citizens from 109 cities with questions on five key areas – health and safety, mobility, activities, opportunities and governance. The ranking also took into account how the cities managed the COVID-19 pandemic with technology.

## 2019

### Singapore took top spot in the IMD-SUTD Smart City Index
 
Our city-state took top spot in the Institute for Management Development (IMD) Smart City Index 2019, ahead of 101 other nations.  

This is a ringing endorsement from our citizens on our Smart Nation goals as the IMD Smart City Index is a unique measure of how citizens perceive their own government’s efforts to make their cities “smart”. 

Citizens effectively rank their city in five key areas - health and safety, mobility, activities, opportunities and governance. 

Singapore’s top score reflects its people’s satisfaction with the government’s use of tech to solve everyday challenges and issues ranging from municipal services to  reducing traffic congestion, to access to job listings online.
