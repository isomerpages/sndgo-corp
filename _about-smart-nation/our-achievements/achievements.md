### Singapore ranked first in KPMG's Global Ranking of Leading Technology Hubs

Singapore clinched the top spot in KPMG’s global ranking of leading technology innovation hubs outside of Silicon Valley/San Francisco in 2021. Singapore pulled ahead of other cities like New York, Tel Aviv, Beijing, and London for the second year running.

The 2021 KPMG Technology Industry Survey surveyed more than 800 global leaders from various sub-sectors in the technology industry on the cities they see as leading technology innovation hubs over the next four years. Among the top factors seen as important in the ranking were an urban locale that attracts young professionals, a pipeline of skilled talent, and modern infrastructure (including high-speed bandwidth).
