# Three Pillars of a Smart Nation

Singapore has set its sights on becoming a world-class, tech-driven city-state. It is transforming itself to become a Smart Nation, harnessing technology to transform how its people and businesses live, work and play.  
  
The digital revolution is upon us, and Singapore must adapt and use technology to 
harvest the benefits of digitalisation.

## Digital Society

A Digital Society empowers everyone  with a fair chance of succeeding despite their differences or circumstances. It inspires us to dream bigger, as we get more interconnected with the world through technology.

Whether you’re young or old, tech-savvy or not, the aim is for every Singaporean to benefit from tech as part of a Digital Society. The <a href="https://www.mci.gov.sg/portfolios/digital-readiness/digital-readiness-blueprint" target="_blank">**Digital Readiness Blueprint**</a> explains how the Singapore Government is  making this happen:

* By making technology more accessible to every Singaporean
* By improving Singaporeans’ digital literacy
* By helping the local community and businesses drive widespread adoption of technology
* By designing inclusive digital services

## Digital Economy

A Digital Economy takes advantage of the latest technology to digitalise processes and drive business growth. This attracts foreign investments which, in turn, creates new jobs and opportunities for those in Singapore.

Singapore’s pro-business environment, excellent tech infrastructure, close connectivity to major Asian economies as well as the availability of investment puts us in a good position to develop a strong Digital Economy.

Three key strategies have been identified in the <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/infocomm-media-landscape/SGDigital/Digital-Economy-Framework-for-Action" target="_blank">**Digital Economy Framework for Action**</a> to take advantage of our strengths:
* Accelerate our economic growth by digitalising industries and businesses
* Develop an ecosystem to help businesses stay vibrant and competitive
* Transform the Infocomm Media  industry to be a key growth driver of the Digital Economy

## Digital Government

Our vision of a Digital Government is “digital to the core, and serves with heart”. Digitalisation is an effective means for the Government to serve citizens with greater empathy, through designing policies and services that are inclusive, seamless and personalised for all.

The [**Digital Government Blueprint (277kb)**](/files/publications/dgb-public-document_30dec20.pdf)  details 14 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure our Government’s digitalisation progress.  

New policies and initiatives are continually being added to the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) to help us chart the fast-changing tides of tech and world events. For example, our ongoing drive to enhance our tech capabilities allowed us to pivot quickly and develop digital tools for contact tracing and the safe re-opening of Singapore’s economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

From 2018 to 2020, our push towards deeper and more extensive digitalisation led to four key changes in the DGB:

**1. Going deeper into what “digital to the core” and “serves with a heart” mean**

There will be greater efforts to use digitalisation to create policies that are more personalised, and which can be easily adjusted in response to user behaviour. This will allow the Government to respond to citizens’ needs more effectively. We have already begun this with new digital platforms such as LifeSG.

**2. Putting the citizen’s needs first**

The blueprint’s strategies have been updated to place more emphasis on users’ needs, to improve how we work, live and play as we harness new technologies such as AI.  

**3. Setting targets to meet our near-term future**
* New KPI:  At least 70% of eligible Government systems to be on commercial cloud by 2023
* Update of an existing KPI: Time required to combine and share data for cross-agency projects to be no more than seven working days  
  
**4. Setting a future direction in light of COVID-19**  
The pandemic has given renewed impetus for government agencies to digitalise, including making deeper changes in organisational policy, structure and culture. 

### The progress so far
Reviewing KPIs regularly allows us to assess our performance and identify areas for improvement. Here are some statistics as of the end of 2019:
* 86% of citizens and 77% of businesses are very/extremely satisfied with Government digital services, surpassing our target of 75%-80%
* 95% of transactions are completed digitally from start to end of the process, meeting the target of 90-95%
* 20,000 officers have been trained in data analytics and data science, meeting the initial target set  and a new KPI is being reviewed
* All 20 ministries have submitted plans to use artificial intelligence, meeting the target of broadening digitalisation within the Government

We’ve also set our sights on goals for 2023 and beyond:
* 70% of eligible Government systems to be hosted on the commercial cloud
* All public officers to have basic digital literacy skills
* All ministry families to have at least 1 AI project for service delivery or policymaking
* At least 10 cross-agency high-impact data analytics projects to be completed per year
* No more than 7 working days to share data for cross-agency projects
