The Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), under the Prime Minister’s Office (<a href="https://www.pmo.gov.sg/" target="_blank">PMO</a>), plans and prioritises key Smart Nation projects and drives the digital transformation of our Government. It also builds long-term capabilities for the public sector, and promotes adoption and participation from the public and industry, to take a collective approach in building a Smart Nation.  
  
With the Government Technology Agency (<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/" target="_blank">GovTech</a>), the implementing arm of SNDGO, both entities are collectively known as the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG). SNDGG is led by Permanent Secretary Mr Ng Chee Khern and Deputy Secretary Mr Tan Kok Yam.
