Data security is a critical safeguard towards building a Smart Nation. Secure and effective use of data and digital solutions are important in policy-making, and in enabling the Government to deliver services to the citizens. The Government has been actively strengthening its data security regime to ensure that data entrusted to the Government is handled and protected with utmost care.

## Public Sector Data Security Review 2019

The Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (”the Committee”) was convened in March 2019 to conduct a comprehensive review of data security policies and practices across the public sector. The Committee completed its work in November 2019, and made five key recommendations to strengthen the Government’s data security regime.

The Government has accepted the Committee’s recommendations and will take the necessary steps to implement them in phases. In Budget 2020, the Government announced that it would invest $1 billion over 3 years to enhance cybersecurity and data security in the public sector.
