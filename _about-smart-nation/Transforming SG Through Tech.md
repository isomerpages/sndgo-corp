As the digital era rapidly evolves, it is up to us to dream and imagine bigger, so that we can realise what it truly means to be a Smart Nation with endless possibilities. 

Our vision for a digital-first Singapore is one where a [Digital Government](/about-smart-nation/digital-government), [Digital Economy](/about-smart-nation/digital-economy) and [Digital Society](/about-smart-nation/digital-society) harness technology to effect transformation in  health, transport, urban living, government services and businesses.

**Our Digital Government** continues to invest in infrastructure and create shared open platforms for our businesses and citizens to learn and develop. 

**Our Digital Economy** spurs businesses to invest in technology and talent to encourage growth beyond our shores.

**Our Digital Society** empowers individuals to cultivate their talents and arm themselves with the latest digital technologies to realise their biggest inspirations, and live better lives together.

The Smart Nation initiative is our way forward. Technology will be so seamlessly integrated that it will transform the way we work, live and play.

## Enabling a Culture of Innovation and Experimentation

Our innovation and growth are rooted in our people and culture. For our Smart Nation initiative to succeed, we need the right policies and legislations, as well as support for research and co-creation from both the public and private sectors. 

You can read about the initiatives we have to facilitate this culture of innovation below.

### Open Data

Data sets collected by public agencies are now available and accessible to the public through online portals, making it easy for developers to co-create digital solutions to benefit society. 

Click on the link to access the available [open data sets](/resources/open-data).

### Living Laboratory

Research and innovation initiatives such as <a href="https://www.nrf.gov.sg/about-nrf/rie-ecosystem" target="_blank">Research, Innovation and Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://www.aisingapore.org/" target="_blank">AI Singapore</a> allow us to leverage emerging tech breakthroughs to drive our Smart Nation goals. Our Digital Economy is also an attractive hotbed for companies and researchers to develop, prototype and pilot their technological solutions.

### Industry and Start-up Ecosystem

Singapore’s start-up ecosystem thrives due to its robust network of venture capitalists, multinational corporations (MNCs), and start-up accelerators such as&nbsp;[SGInnovate](https://www.sginnovate.com/). Initiatives like&nbsp;[LaunchPad](https://www.jtc.gov.sg/find-land/land-for-long-term-development/launchpad)&nbsp;provide an ideal environment for startups and entrepreneurs to collaborate, innovate, and scale their businesses by offering a comprehensive range of tailored resources and facilities.  

Currently, Singapore is actively developing the&nbsp;[Punggol Digital District (PDD)](https://estates.jtc.gov.sg/pdd), which is widely anticipated to become the country's premier smart district.&nbsp;Master planned and developed by&nbsp;[JTC](https://www.jtc.gov.sg/),&nbsp;PDD aims to be an innovative hub for work and life, fostering collaboration and interaction among innovators and the community to bring ideas to fruition.

### Cybersecurity and Data Privacy

Cybersecurity helps us safeguard our Smart Nation growth by keeping critical systems and networks secure. We have our eye on possible risks and prioritise data privacy at all times.

### Computational Capabilities and Digital Inclusion

Basic coding and computational thinking skills will help everyone benefit from our Smart Nation growth, regardless of age or digital literacy. We currently offer resources to assist both [individuals](/community/opportunities) and [businesses](/resources/business) to re-skill, so that they can leverage the growing opportunities of our Digital Economy.

Check out the resources available for [individuals](/community/opportunities) and [businesses.](/resources/business)

### Cross-border Collaboration

One way for us to grow is through sharing good ideas and best practices, exploring collaborations, and testing people-centric smart solutions within the region.

The <a href="https://asean.org/asean/asean-smart-cities-network/" target="_blank">ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN)</a> was established in 2018, offering a platform for ASEAN cities to exchange ideas and solutions to catalyse smart city projects.

The goal is to improve the lives of people in the region, using technology as an enabler. ASCN provides us with the unique opportunity to quickly leverage opportunities from rapid urbanisation, as well as build a strong defence against cyber threats and trade friction that the region faces.
