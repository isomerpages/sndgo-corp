# Digital Economy

A Digital Economy takes advantage of the latest technology to digitalise processes and drive business growth. This attracts foreign investments which, in turn, creates new jobs and opportunities for those in Singapore.

Singaporeâ€™s pro-business environment, excellent tech infrastructure, close connectivity to major Asian economies as well as the availability of investment puts us in a good position to develop a strong Digital Economy.

Three key strategies have been identified in the <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/infocomm-media-landscape/SGDigital/Digital-Economy-Framework-for-Action">Digital Economy Framework for Action</a> to take advantage of our strengths:
* Accelerate our economic growth by digitalising industries and businesses
* Develop an ecosystem to help businesses stay vibrant and competitive
* Transform the Infocomm Media  industry to be a key growth driver of the Digital Economy
