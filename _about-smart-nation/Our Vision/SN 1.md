Smart Nation 1.0 was developed to help Singapore ride the wave of change and leverage digital technologies to transform domains like health, transport, education, finance, infrastructure, and the environment.

To increase digital adoption, strategic national projects like our digital identity system, Singpass, and e-payment networks were launched. We&nbsp;promoted digitalisation across the government, society, and economy and strengthened our digital security.

Citizens’ lives have been improved by the Government’s efforts to create digital products and services across digital economy, society, government, and security. Some of these products make daily activities more enjoyable in small but powerful ways; others provide citizens with faster, more personalised services.

In the years ahead, our Smart Nation vision will remain firmly anchored on improving citizens’ lives as&nbsp;better digital products and services continue to be developed to address these evolving concerns and needs.
