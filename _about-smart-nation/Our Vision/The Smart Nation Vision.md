The Smart Nation initiative is a whole-of-nation effort led by the [Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI)](https://mddi.gov.sg) to build a thriving digital future for all.

The [inaugural Smart Nation initiative](/sn1) was launched in 2014, driven by a compelling vision: **to build better, meaningful, and fulfilled lives for our people, enabled by technology**.

Singapore has made significant progress since 2014. Digital technologies have become an integral part of our lives, influencing how we live, work, and play.

Technology holds tremendous promise in helping Singapore break new ground. While we continue to harness technology as a force for good, we must also address risks such as challenges to individual wellbeing and social harmony.

In 2024, the [refreshed Smart Nation vision](/sn2) was unveiled, outlining Singaporeâ€™s approach **to build a thriving digital future for all**.
