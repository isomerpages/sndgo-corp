The Smart Nation initiative is a whole-of-nation effort led by the [Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI)](mddi.gov.sg) to build a thriving digital future for all.

The [inaugural Smart Nation initiative](/sn1) was launched in 2014, driven by a compelling vision:&nbsp;to build better, meaningful, and fulfilled lives for our people, enabled by technology.

Singapore has made significant progress since 2014. Digital technologies&nbsp;have become an integral and fundamental part of our lives, influencing how we live, work, and play. Technology holds tremendous promise in helping Singapore break new ground.&nbsp;While we continue to harness technology as a force for good and maximise opportunities for our people, risks such as challenges to our individual wellbeing and social harmony&nbsp;must also be addressed.

In 2024, the [refreshed Smart Nation vision](/sn2) was unveiled, outlining Singaporeâ€™s approach to achieving a thriving digital future for all.
