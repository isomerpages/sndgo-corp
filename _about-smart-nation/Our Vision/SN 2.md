# Smart Nation 2.0: A Refreshed Vision

Since the launch Smart Nation in 2014, Singaporeâ€™s efforts in harnessing digital technologies to transform our economy, society, government, and security have have paid off, establishing our country as a leader in areas like digital infrastructure and inclusion.

The mark of a truly Smart Nation is to keep striving to be better. Digital developments have given rise to new opportunities and challenges for Singapore and for humanity.&nbsp;The refreshed Smart Nation 2.0 vision must address these evolving needs and concerns.

The impact of technology on our humanity and society&nbsp;must be continuously examined and digital developments must be shaped and directed toward outcomes that benefit Singaporeans, with the need to uphold our shared values as a nation to move forward together as a guide.
