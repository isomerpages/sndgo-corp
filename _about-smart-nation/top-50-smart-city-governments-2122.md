# Climbing to the Top

[Eden Strategy Institute](https://www.edenstrategyinstitute.com/) and ONG&amp;ONG have put together a biennial study that ranks Smart City Governments across the world. The study focuses on the role of city governments and how they drive their smart city initiatives. 

In this 2nd edition, Singapore has taken the top honours out of over 230 cities that were evaluated by Eden Strategy Institute. Seoul and London took the 2nd and 3rd spots respectively with the third Asian city – Shanghai – in the Top 10 at 8th spot. 

The Top 50 Smart City Government ranking is based on the Institute’s secondary research into the cities, as well as information submitted by the cities themselves.  The ranking is based on ten key factors: 

1. **Vision** - A clear and well-defined strategy to develop a “smart city” 
2. **Leadership** - Dedicated city leadership that steers smart city projects 
3. **Budget** - Sufficient funding for smart city projects 
4. **Financial**- Financial incentives to effectively encourage private sector participation (e.g. grants, rebates, subsidies, competitions) 
5. **Support Programmes** - In-kind programmes to encourage private actors to participate (e.g. incubators, events, networks) 
6. **Policies** - A conducive policy environment for smart city development (e.g. data governance, IP protection, urban design) 
7. **Ecosystems** - A comprehensive range of engaged stakeholders to sustain innovation 
8. **People-Centricity** - A sincere, people-first design of the future city 
9. **Talent-Readiness** - Programmes to equip the city’s talent with smart skills 
10. **Track Record** - The government’s experience in catalysing successful smart city initiatives
