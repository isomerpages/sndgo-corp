## AI for Public Good, for Singapore and the World

As a Smart Nation, our commitment extends beyond merely embracing technology; we aspire to be at the forefront, setting the pace, and driving global innovation and conversations in tech, including AI. 

In 2019, we unveiled the [Singapore National AI Strategy (NAIS)](/files/publications/national-ai-strategy.pdf), outlining plans to deepen the use of AI to transform our economy. Our early investment in AI led to the establishment of about 150 teams working on research and development, and 900 startups exploring new ideas with AI. Since then, we've witnessed significant breakthroughs in AI, resulting in the development of new products, enhanced capabilities, and transformative interactions. 

In 2023, in our ongoing pursuit of setting the pace, we launched the [Singapore National AI Strategy 2.0  (NAIS 2.0)](/files/publications/national-ai-strategy.pdf).

### Singapore National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0)


To propel ourselves further as leaders in the field AI, three key shifts from our initial National AI Strategy are imperative for NAIS 2.0:

		<div class="header"><b>From Opportunity to Necessity</b></div><br>
		<div class="para">The expanded landscape of opportunities and risks brought forth by AI today make clear that AI is indispensable for the continued prosperity and relevance as a nation. We must master AI, rather than think of it merely as an accessory or a luxury.

	<div class="header"><b>From Local to Global</b></div><br>
	<div class="para">Singapore must operate, from the outset, with a global outlook for AI. We must connect to global networks, working with the best and pooling resources among the like-minded to overcome the complex challenges that plague AI today.&nbsp;

	<div class="header"><b>From Projects to Systems</b></div><br>
	<div class="para">We must further enhance our capability, infrastructure and resource foundations, and accelerate ideas exchange at scale, to amplify and manage the impact of AI across various sectors, and in economy and society at large.

<br></div></div>


Guided by the vision “AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World”, NAIS 2.0 focuses on two&nbsp;twin&nbsp;goals:

<a href="/initiatives/strategic-national-projects/gobusiness"><img src="/images/initiatives/business-grant-portal-overview.jpeg" alt="GoBusiness"></a><br>
	
<div class="header"><b>Excellence</b></div><br>
<div class="para">Singapore will selectively develop peaks of excellence in AI, to advance the field and maximise value creation. We intend to direct AI towards addressing the needs and challenges of our time, such as in areas of global importance like population health and climate change.</div><br>

<div class="col"> 
<a href="/initiatives/strategic-national-projects/codex"><img src="/images/initiatives/codex-snp.jpeg" alt="CODEX"></a><br>

<div class="header"><b>Empowerment</b></div><br>
<div class="para">Singapore will raise up individuals, businesses, and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment, and trust. We intend for AI to be the great equaliser, which equips our people and businesses with the capabilities and resources to thrive in an AI-enabled future.</div><br>

NAIS 2.0 outlines our strategy to harness **10 enablers**, unlocking Singapore's AI potential and supporting our AI ambitions. Over the next three to five years, we will implement **15 actions**, with ongoing reviews to respond to fast-moving developments in AI, across domains.

#### 15 Actions of NAIS 2.0

**Orchestrate to Build Peaks of Excellence**

<div style="font-size:15px; line-height:15px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px;">

1. <div style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px;">Anchor <b>new AI Centres of Excellence (CoE)</b>&nbsp;across companies, and explore establishing Sectoral AI CoEs to drive sophisticated AI value creation and usage in key sectors</div>

2.  <div style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px;">Strengthen our AI start-up ecosystem, including attracting&nbsp;<b>AI-focused accelerator programmes</b>&nbsp;to spur rapid AI experimentation

The third system we have&nbsp;identified is Infrastructure and Environment, which is powered by four enablers – Compute, Data, Trusted Environment and Leader in Thought and Action. With these enablers, we will:  
  

10\. Significantly increase&nbsp;**high-performance compute**&nbsp;available in Singapore

11\. Build&nbsp;**capabilities in privacy enhancing technologies and data services**

12\. Unlock&nbsp;**Government data**&nbsp;for Public Good use cases
