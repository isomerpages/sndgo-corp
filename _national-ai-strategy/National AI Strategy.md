## AI for Public Good, for Singapore and the World

As a Smart Nation, our commitment extends beyond merely embracing technology; we aspire to be at the forefront, setting the pace, and driving global innovation and conversations in tech, including AI. 

In 2019, we unveiled the Singapore National AI Strategy, outlining plans to deepen the use of AI to transform our economy. Our early investment in AI led to the establishment of about 150 teams working on research and development, and 900 startups exploring new ideas with AI. Since then, we've witnessed significant breakthroughs in AI, resulting in the development of new products, enhanced capabilities, and transformative interactions. 

In 2023, in our ongoing pursuit of setting the pace, we launched the Singapore National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0).

### Singapore National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0)


To propel ourselves further as leaders in the field AI, three key shifts from our initial National AI Strategy are imperative for NAIS 2.0:

Guided by the vision “AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World”, NAIS 2.0 focuses on two&nbsp;twin&nbsp;goals:

<div class="col"> 
<a href="/initiatives/strategic-national-projects/gobusiness"><img src="/images/initiatives/business-grant-portal-overview.jpeg" alt="GoBusiness"></a><br><b>Empowerment</b><br><br>Singapore will raise up individuals, businesses, and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment, and trust. We intend for AI to be the great equaliser, which equips our people and businesses with the capabilities and resources to thrive in an AI-enabled future.&nbsp;<br></div>
