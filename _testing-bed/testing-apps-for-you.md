		<h3>LifeSG</h3> 
		LifeSG is your one-stop personalised access to government services and information.<br>

		<br>
		LifeSG connects you to the right services and information. It is the easiest way to keep up with your government to-do list: schemes, benefits,                     applications, events and more.<br>

		<h3>MyResponder</h3> 
		MyResponder alerts members of public of nearby fire and medical cases should they be able to help as every minute counts in an emergency and timely interventions can help save lives.<br>
		<br>
		Volunteers will be alerted to help Out-of-Hospital cardiac arrest victims within their immediate vicinity. The enlisting first Aiders' help the cardiac arrest victims during the first few critical minutes improves survival rate before the ambulance arrives. The App also helps you locate the closest AED should you require one!<br>
		<br>
		In fire instances, volunteers are encouraged to send photos to SCDF for scene assessment, to enable them to have as much information as possible, before arriving on the scene. For smaller fires, they could even help put it out if there were suitable means (e.g. extinguishers, buckets of water, etc.) around – as long as it is safe for them to do so.<br>
