Wonder what it feels like to live in the “smartest” city in the world? Ask a Singaporean.

Our city-state has taken top spot in the Institute for Management Development (IMD) Smart City Index 2019, ahead of 101 other nations.  

This is a ringing endorsement from our citizens on our Smart Nation goals as the IMD Smart City Index is a unique measure of how citizens perceive their own government’s efforts to make their cities “smart”. Citizens effectively rank their city in five key areas: 

* Health and safety
* Mobility
* Activities
* Opportunities 
* Governance

Singapore’s top score reflects its people’s satisfaction with the government’s use of tech to solve everyday challenges and issues ranging from municipal services to  reducing traffic congestion, to access to job listings online. 

With this achievement, we’re likely to draw in more quality investment and talent, positioning us for greater social, economic and policy growth for a smarter future.

The IMD Smart City Index 2019 was launched by IMD World Competitive Centre’s Smart City Observatory and Singapore University of Technology and Design.
