# KampungSpirit

Less fortunate families need essential items, and it can be tough for one person to provide all the help. But what if we could bring together 10,000 donors to make a bigger difference?

That's the idea behind [KampungSpirit](https://kampungspirit.gov.sg/), a space where the entire village (or 'kampung' in Malay) can chip in to buy things like rice cookers, washing machines, milk/diapers (and more!) for households in dire need of them. 

These are families under the care of social workers, who vet each item that goes on the platform.
