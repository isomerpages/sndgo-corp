[Giving.sg](https://www.giving.sg/) is your one-stop national giving platform to donate, volunteer and fundraise for any of the over 600 registered non-profits in Singapore. Online giving is safe, meaningful, and simple with us.

The vision of our giving is to build a City of Good - a Singapore where Individuals, Organisations and Leaders come together to give their best for others. Together, we want to embrace an other-centered mindset, valuing people above all else, and nurturing a Singapore that truly cares.

City of Good fuels the national Singapore Cares movement to build a caring and inclusive home for everyone, where care is an integral part of our Singaporean identity and way of life.
