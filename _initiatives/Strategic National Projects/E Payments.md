Electronic payments (E-payments) are today simple, swift, seamless and secure digital transactions. As we move towards more of such transactions, e-payments will increasingly become a vital mode of payment for everyone - citizens and businesses alike.

## The Journey So Far

To make financial transactions more seamless and efficient for all, we’re constantly working towards a simple and secure platform that operates across various systems. 

Here’s a quick look at some of the milestones so far:

* **FAST (Fast and Secure Transfers) launched in 2014**
	* Facilitates direct, real-time transfers between consumers and businesses across different banks
* **PayNow launched in 2017**
	* Facilitates real-time peer-to-peer transfers between customers of participating banks by entering a mobile or personal identification number
* **PayNow Corporate launched in 2018**
	* Allows businesses and Government agencies to pay and receive funds instantaneously using a Unique Entity Number
* **NETS developed an interoperable and open-access e-payment solution in 2018**
	* The payments infrastructure covers 200 coffee shops, 25 hawker centres and 20 industrial canteens, making transactions more convenient
* **Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR) standard introduced in 2018**
	* With SGQR, merchants need just one QR code to accept mobile payments from different service providers
* **Non-bank financial institutions**  **received**  **access to FAST in 2021**
	* Provides consumers and businesses with additional options to make financial transactions more conveniently
