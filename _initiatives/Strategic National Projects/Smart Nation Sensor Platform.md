# Using Data to Build a Better Future

![Smart Nation Sensor Platform](/images/initiatives/smart-nation-sensor-platform-snp.jpeg)

In this digital age, weâ€™re surrounded by huge amounts of data. The question is how we can organise and tap on the most relevant data,  to plan and develop better solutions that will improve the way we live in our city. 

The answer lies in our Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP). This is an integrated, nationwide platform that uses sensors to collect essential data that can be analysed to create smart solutions. 

Read on to find out how.

## Tracking Water Usage and Leaks

In 2020, we completed the third wireless sensor network trial to collect water data transmitted from smart meters in many homes across Hougang. The results from earlier trials in Yuhua (2018) and Punggol (2016) were encouraging, showing that smart meters can help homeowners save water by providing near real-time water usage data and detect water leaks via a mobile app.

In January 2022, we began installing meters in Tampines and have since phased installation of smart water meters in 7 postal sectors in homes, commercial and industrial premises across Singapore.

## Drowning Detection System at Public Pools

We are conducting a pilot at our public swimming pools to use computer vision to detect possible drowning incidents.  The system helps to alert lifeguards so they can react faster to swimmers in distress and those in need.

## Personal Alert Button for Elderly

As of April 2021, more than 5,600 seniors who live in rental blocks now have the Personal Alert Button (PAB) installed in their flats. This allows them to request for emergency help if needed.  

When the PAB is triggered, an alert will be sent to a Senior Activity Centre where staff can quickly assess the situation. With the two-way voice communication system,  help can then be dispatched to the unit quickly.
