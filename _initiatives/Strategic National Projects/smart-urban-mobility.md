# Remaking Our Transportation Roadmap 
 
As a land-scarce city with a growing population, Singapore needs an efficient transportation infrastructure to run smoothly. This is why we’ve identified Smart Urban Mobility as one of our strategic national projects.

It uses digital technologies to find smart solutions that enhance our public transport system and provide greater comfort, convenience, reliability and support for our vision of a car-lite Singapore.

## An Improved Commuting Experience

By analysing anonymised data obtained from commuters’ fare cards, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) can easily identify commuter hotspots. This helps them better manage bus fleets, making the bus system more efficient.

The data also provides information on which bus routes are more popular, making it easier for LTA and the bus operators to meet commuters' commuting needs.

## Hands-Free Ticketing Technology

Making our public transport system more inclusive is one of our top priorities. We are exploring the use of hands-free fare gates that allow the elderly, families with young children and commuters with mobility challenges to enter and exit train stations and buses quickly - without the need to tap their fare cards on the card readers.

## Self-driving Shuttles

Currently, we are conducting several trials to understand how technology can be used to better connect towns and enhance mobility for commuters, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities.

These trials will help us to assess the feasibility of autonomous or self-driving vehicles and how these can help us improve your commuter experience during peak hours or late-night services.
