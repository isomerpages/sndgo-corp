# Business Grants and Licenses At Your Fingertips

For a business, it can be costly and time-consuming – not to mention mind-boggling - to trawl through different Government websites to apply for grants and licenses.

To make such transactions easier, the Government has consolidated applications for grants and licenses and made these available on two websites.

## Business Grants Portal

The Business Grants Portal is a one-stop shop for businesses to apply for grants. There is no longer a need to approach different Government agencies separately, or repeatedly provide the same information for each grant application.

## GoBusiness Licensing Portal

GoBusiness Licensing Portal allows businesses to apply, amend, renew or terminate licences from multiple agencies easily, helping them save precious time.

Visit the <a href="https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/business-grants-portal/" target="_blank">Business Grants Portal</a> and <a href="https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences/" target="_blank">GoBusiness Licensing Portal</a> for more information.
