Many different issues and concerns arose as a result of the pandemic. Due to the economic crisis, jobs were lost or salaries reduced. Students had to settle for home-based learning.

As such, platforms were quickly set up to assist with the various changes â€“ such as websites to apply for COVID-19 grants.

## COVID-19 GoBusiness portal

The [GoBusiness platform](https://gobusiness.gov.sg/) for business was used as a one-stop portal to provide businesses with information on safe management requirements and to apply to resume operations.

## COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) application portal

The COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) was launched in May 2020 to provide temporary support to Singaporeans whose jobs were affected by COVID-19. The CSG application portal assisted in approving 98,000 applications.

In 2021, the CSG was replaced with the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG), featuring revised eligibility criteria.

## COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) application portal

Launched in January 2021, the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) continued to provide support to workers who needed temporary financial assistance. The Grant focused on workers in lower- to middle-income households who experienced involuntary job loss.

## SupportGoWhere 

SupportGoWhere, a LifeSG initiative, provided citizens with a single portal to determine which assistance schemes they would be eligible for. It also had an Eligibility Checker, which listed the schemes that might be available to you when you answered a few questions.

## Student Learning Space

When schools had to be closed during the circuit breaker period, MOE tapped on the [Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/student-learning-space) to ensure that learning could continue while the world battled COVID-19. With the help of SLS, 420,000 students and 33,000 teachers transitioned smoothly to home-based learning.
