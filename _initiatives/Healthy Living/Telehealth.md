# Medical Consultations in the Comfort of Your Own Home
![TeleHealth](/images/initiatives/telehealth.jpeg)

TeleHealth offers integrated, seamless medical care in the form of online medical consultations without having to go down to the healthcare institution in person. It allows better use of resources, greater efficiency and less stress for patients and healthcare providers alike. 
  
## Smart Health Video Consultation for Healthcare

Launched in April 2017, such video consultations allow patients to speak with their care team remotely via video conferencing. It is especially helpful when patients need immediate care, but in-person visits are difficult for them to manage. The platform is used in areas such as:

* Follow-up services for paediatric eczema pharmacy consultation
* Paediatric home-care services
* Lactation consultation
* Speech therapy for KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital patients
* Post-stroke, infectious diseases and cancer patient care
