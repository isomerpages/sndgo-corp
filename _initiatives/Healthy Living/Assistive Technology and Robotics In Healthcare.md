# Improving Healthcare with Assistive Technology and Robotics

![robotics in healthcare](/images/initiatives/health-robotics.jpg)

The importance of healthcare as a critical service cannot be overstated, especially when it comes to ensuring access for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. 

Below are three areas of focus that outline how we are using assistive technology and robotics to meet the healthcare needs of these individuals and enhance their quality of life.

### 1. Enhance Overall Wellbeing

Our ongoing research in assistive technology and robotics is yielding promising solutions that can turn independent living into a reality for the elderly and people with disabilities. Our goal is to empower them to carry out their daily tasks and activities independently, ultimately enhancing their overall well-being.

### 2. Improve Patient Care

Some of the ways we use robotics to enhance patient care include automated bathing machines and droids that monitor mobility progress. Robots can also aid stroke patients in their recovery exercises and remind early-stage dementia patients to take their medication.

### 3. Enhanced Productivity in Healthcare

We use technology to lighten the workload of our healthcare workers. This includes using drones to deliver medicines and equipment, employing data analytics to improve operations and reduce waiting times, and utilizing augmented reality to assist doctors in learning medical treatments and procedures.

## Centre for Healthcare Assistive and Robotics Technology (CHART)

Established with the support of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), the [Centre for Healthcare Assistive &amp; Robotics Technology (CHART)](https://www.cgh.com.sg/chart) is a platform that enables healthcare professionals to work closely with industry, academia and research institutions to co-develop and testbed impactful healthcare solutions in assistive technologies and robotics. CHART also works with the National Robotics Programme, a multi-agency initiative to coordinate and support the end-to-end development of robotics technologies.

CHART will achieve its objectives through conducting technology roadmapping with solution providers to identify synergies between healthcare &amp; technological requirements and providing user insights to co-design and develop healthcare solutions. CHART also provides testbedding space and works with healthcare providers across health systems to conduct trials to validate effectiveness of solutions and solutions adoption.

## Healthcare Robots

Read on to find out more about the robots that are transforming our healthcare sector.

### RoboCoach Xian

RoboCoach Xian is a robotic trainer that teaches physical exercise routines to senior citizens, either individually or in groups. It provides personalized, gentle exercise routines suitable for the elderly and young children, minimizing the risk of injury.

Most importantly, it also offers physical and cognitive therapy to seniors who have experienced strokes or are dealing with conditions such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s.

Currently, we are actively researching ways to further improve RoboCoach Xian. One potential enhancement is the inclusion of a screen reader to facilitate easier learning and communication for the visually impaired.

### Dexie

Dexie is the first of its kind multi-competent social robot for dementia care that supports social interactions with people with dementia in a care environment. It has the ability to engage in activities like physical exercises, play games, and hold conversations.
