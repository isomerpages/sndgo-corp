Collecting and analysing data on how we use water can go a long way towards helping us become more efficient with the precious resource. PUB, our national water agency, is progressively rolling out smart water meters to replace our current mechanical meters.

The smart water meters are designed to monitor, collect and make data on the use of water readily accessible for consumers via a mobile app.

## Automated Meter Reading (AMR) Trial

The AMR trial is part of the <a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/news/pressreleases/transformingpubintothesmartutilityofthefuture" target="_blank">SMART PUB roadmap</a> to digitalise Singapore’s entire water system. The roadmap allows PUB to improve its operations through smarter water quality management, network improvements, integrated customer engagements and smarter work processes.

Most importantly, it outlines a plan for us to meet our future water needs.

To test the potential of smart water meters, PUB conducted two pilot trials in 2016 and 2018. Eight hundred households were fitted with AMR-enabled water meters that register and transmit readings wirelessly to PUB and provide data analytics on households’ water consumption patterns.

Residents from these households were given access to a mobile app that allowed them to track their detailed water consumption and receive leak and high-usage notifications. They found the daily usage trend the most practical feature in the app as they can make water-saving adjustments accordingly based on the data received.

## The Smart Water Meter Programme

Based on the success of the AMR trials, PUB has launched the Smart Water Meter Programme.

The first phase of this programme will see the installation of 300,000 smart water meters in new and existing residential, commercial and industrial premises by 2023. It empowers water efficiency, allows for the early detection of leaks, and goes a long way towards saving water and money.
