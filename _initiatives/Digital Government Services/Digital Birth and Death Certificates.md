As part of the Singapore Government’s ongoing effort to streamline and digitalise its services to serve citizens better, birth and death certificates are going digital. 

For parents, this means having more time to spend with your newborn instead of queuing up to collect their birth certificates at ICA Building. Registration is simple - do it via the LifeSG app and, once approved, you’d have 90 days to download the document and save it on your personal devices.

The registration of death will also be streamlined such that bereaved family members can focus their attention on things other than post-death administrative tasks.
