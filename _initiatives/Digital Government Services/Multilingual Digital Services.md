# Tech that Speaks Your Language
![multilingual digital services](/images/initiatives/multilingual-digital-services.jpeg)

To ensure that our Government digital services are accessible by a wide segment of society, we have been rolling out multilingual options since October 2018, mainly for digital services that are widely and commonly used by citizens. 

Currently, these are some services that citizens can access in 4 languages: 

* Check their Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board balances 
* Apply for the Housing & Development Board’s (HDB) Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) grant 
* Make online medical appointments at the National Healthcare Group’s polyclinics
