![LifeSG](/images/initiatives/lifesg-kv.jpg)

Originally known as Moments of Life, the <a href="http://www.life.gov.sg" target="_blank">app</a> was launched in June 2018, with modules to support families with young children, and seniors . The app was rebranded to LifeSG in August 2020, with new features to serve Singaporeans throughout their life journey.

Today, LifeSG allows you to easily access Government services, keep up with the latest news and updates, track your applications and more.
