The [Singapore Government Developer Portal](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/) is **a one-stop resource hub for government digital products and services.**

We target government agencies, vendors, and tech professionals such as developers who are engaged in digital transformation projects. To stay updated on our latest product information,

Audiences can also find information about the [Singapore Government Tech Stack](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack) which are a set of platform tools that streamlines and simplifies the development process and enables code reuse across the government.

**2.  Documentation Service**

Our documentation service houses technical documentation including playbooks, onboarding guides, API specs and publication guides.

Our guidelines help project teams implement best practices, refine their success metrics, improve procurement workflows and more.
