## Building a smarter nation, one task at a time

[CrowdTaskSG](https://www.crowdtask.gov.sg/) is a web portal for government agencies in Singapore to engage citizens and gather insights through crowdsourcing tasks. These tasks include surveys, opinion polls, choice questions, and translation requests.

For every task completed, participants can earn virtual Coins that can be used to redeem rewards, such as vouchers.
