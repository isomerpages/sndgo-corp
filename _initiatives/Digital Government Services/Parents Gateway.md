# Gateway to Better Parent–School Communication
![Parents Gateway app screen shots](/images/initiatives/Parent-gateway-screenshots.jpeg)


Parents, are you tired of trying to keep track of the information and consent forms sent by your child’s school? We hear you.
 
Parents Gateway is an app for schools to disseminate information, and seek parents’ consent on admin matters, in a consolidated digital form. It gives you greater access and control over your child’s participation in school activities and for you to better manage school-related administrative tasks.

It also frees up time and reduces the administrative workload for teachers, allowing them to focus on teaching and nurturing your child.


#### Designed in Collaboration

The app  is the result of close collaboration between various Government divisions and agencies, built with feedback from parents and teachers. 

User behaviour and needs were taken into consideration and applied to the final design. For instance, it has a calendar and in-app notifications to alert parents of information they need to know about. 

It is also regularly reviewed and refined to take into account the changing needs in the education landscape.
