[ScamShield](https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/) is a suite of products and tools that helps defend against scams. The suite consists of the ScamShield helpline (reachable at 1799), ScamShield app (for iPhone and Android), a website ([www.scamshield.gov.sg](http://www.scamshield.gov.sg/)) with a range of anti-scam resources, and ScamShield Alert Social Channels on WhatsApp and Telegram.  
  
Each of these plays a crucial role in empowering individuals to fight against scams, as well as keeping the community safe from fraudulent activities.

## ScamShield App

The ScamShield App lets you check suspicious calls, websites, and messages (SMS, Telegram, and WhatsApp) to know if they’re scams. Together with improved blocking and filtering of scam calls and SMSes, the app offers better protection against scams for you and your loved ones.
