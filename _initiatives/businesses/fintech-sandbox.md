**Why is FinTech important?**

-   Advancements in financial technology, also known as “FinTech”, are increasingly challenging the way business is being done
-   To maintain our status as a regional financial hub, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has set its sights on creating a Smart Financial Centre where technology is used pervasively in the financial industry to increase efficiency, create economic opportunities, and allow for better management of risks.

**Fintech initiatives**

Efforts are being put in place to nurture a FinTech environment that supports innovation in the financial services, and where financial institutions such as banks, can experiment with the application of new technologies in a safe environment.

-   **Looking Glass @ MAS**

The MAS  [opened](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2016/mas-establishes-fintech-innovation-lab) its FinTech Innovation Lab to serve as a platform for the FinTech community to connect, collaborate, and co-create with one another.

-   **"Regulatory Sandbox"**

To provide a conducive environment for FinTech experiments and allow innovations a better chance to take root, the MAS is taking on a responsive and forward-looking regulatory approach.

It released a consultation paper on proposed guidelines for a “regulatory sandbox” that will enable financial institutions and non-financial players to experiment with FinTech solutions.

In November, MAS issued the [](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2016/mas-issues-regulatory-sandbox-guidelines-for-fintech-experiments) ["Regulatory Sandbox" guidelines](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2016/mas-issues-regulatory-sandbox-guidelines-for-fintech-experiments) for FinTech experiments.

-   **One-stop virtual entity for FinTech matters**

Plans are in place to set up a one-stop virtual entity for all FinTech related matters and to promote Singapore as a FinTech hub. Members of the office include MAS, Economic Development Board of Singapore, Infocomm Investments Pte Ltd, Info-communications Media Development Authority, National Research Foundation, and SPRING Singapore.

-   **Open data**

To encourage and facilitate development of innovative solutions, MAS published 12 sets of data from the MAS' Monthly Statistical Bulletin as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on their  [website](http://www.mas.gov.sg/Statistics/APIs.aspx).
