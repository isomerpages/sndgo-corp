## Working together to better make use of AI

The success of our National AI Strategy depends on Singaporeans, businesses, researchers and the Government coming together to work closely towards our goals. We will also need to work with international partners to better make use of AI in Singapore.

You can play a part in our future success by contributing through one of these four ways:

#### 1. Submit ideas and solutions for National AI Projects

If you have any ideas, solutions or even proposals for new National AI projects, send them our way via this [form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5dbbe22a895bd6001283542e).

#### 2. Transform your business with AI

If your business is already using AI, you can take part in data sharing initiatives to promote the greater use of the tech and contribute to a trusted environment by adopting AI governance initiatives.

You can also take advantage of the following resources to kickstart or advance your AI transformation journey:

#### 3. Participate in Singapore’s AI ecosystem
As we transform our key sectors using AI, there will be many opportunities for businesses to research, develop and deploy such technologies in Singapore and the region.

As a local or international investor, you can establish an AI team in Singapore and leverage our research ecosystem to enhance and validate new AI methodologies.

The Government supports your participation in our AI ecosystem with the following initiatives:
- [IMDA’s Accreditation@SGD](https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/imda-accreditation) and [SG:D Spark programmes](https://www.imda.gov.sg/disg/Programmes/2019/04/sgd-spark)

#### 4. Learn about AI

It’s crucial for every Singaporean to upgrade and improve our skills so that we can keep up with the advances of AI and be ready to take on the exciting jobs that are created.
