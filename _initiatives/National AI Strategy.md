# The Next Frontier of Singapore's Smart Nation Journey
As a Smart Nation, we want to go beyond just adopting technology. Our aim is to fundamentally rethink business models, so that we can make impactful changes to reap productivity gains and create new growth areas.

By 2030, we see Singapore as a leader in developing and deploying scalable, impactful artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, in key sectors of high value and relevance to our citizens and businesses.


## National Artificial Intelligence Strategy

The National AI Strategy outlines our plans to deepen the use of AI to transform our economy:

 - Identify areas to focus attention and resources on at a national level
 - Set out how the Government, companies and researchers can work together to realise the positive impact from AI
 - Address areas where attention is needed to manage change and/or manage new forms of risks that emerge when AI becomes more pervasive

## Building a Vibrant Ecosystem for Sustained AI Innovation

In order to drive AI innovation and adoption, we must build a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem. To do so, we’ve identified five critical ecosystem enablers.

![Ecosystem Enablers for AI](/images/initiatives/Ecosystem_Enablers_for_AI.jpg)

 1. **Triple helix partnerships** between the research community, industry and Government enables the rapid commercialisation of fundamental research and deployment of AI solutions.
 2. **Talent and education** addresses the need to develop homegrown talent across the entire range of AI-related job roles and helps Singaporeans prepare for the future AI economy.
 3. **Data architecture** enables quick and secure access to high-quality datasets across various sectors.
 4. A **progressive & trusted environment** is important for test-bedding, developing and deploying AI solutions.
 5. **International collaborations** to drive and support sustainable development of AI with multi-nationals researchers, businesses and governments. 

## Seven National AI Programmes that Address Key Challenges

We have also identified seven National AI Projects that can deliver strong social and economic impact for Singapore and Singaporeans.

![National AI Programmes](/images/initiatives/National_AI_Programmes.jpg)

**1. Healthcare:** Chronic disease prediction and management helps with faster detection and treatment of such diseases.

**2. Smart estates:** Municipal services are delivered in a more responsive, reliable and timely for citizens.

**3. Education:** Personalised education through adaptive learning and assessment helps teachers better customise and improve their students learning experience.

**4. Border security:** Border clearance operations strengthen security while improving travellers’ experience.

**5. Logistics:** Intelligent freight planning optimises the movement of freight for greater business productivity and traffic efficiency.

**6. Finance:** Growing Singapore into a global hub for financial AI solutions. 

**7. Government:** Leveraging AI to transform government services to deliver  high-impact outcomes for citizens and businesses.


## Working Together

The success of our National AI Strategy depends on Singaporeans, businesses, researchers and the Government coming together to work closely towards our goals. We will also need to work with international partners to better make use of AI in Singapore.

You can play a part in our future success by contributing through one of these four ways:

#### 1. Submit ideas and solutions for National AI Projects

If you have any ideas, solutions or even proposals for new National AI projects, send them our way via this [form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5dbbe22a895bd6001283542e).

#### 2. Transform your business with AI

If your business is already using AI, you can take part in data sharing initiatives to promote the greater use of the tech and contribute to a trusted environment by adopting AI governance initiatives.

You can also take advantage of the following resources to kickstart or advance your AI transformation journey:
