The [National Steps Challenge™](https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/37/nsc) is the world’s first population level, fitness tracker-based physical activity initiative that encourages Singaporeans to move more. 

By leveraging behavioural insights and technology, the Challenge encourages Singaporeans to take more steps and clock moderate-to-vigorous physical activities daily as part of their everyday lives. They do so using a fitness tracker and the Healthy 365 mobile application.

It also rewards them when they reach different physical activity milestones. Participants can look forward to exciting sub-challenges and thematic challenges – all geared towards making moving more fun. 

The National Steps Challenge™ has been well received and these are some of its milestone moments:

* Season 5 of the Challenge attracted over 910,000 sign-ups
* Results show that participants’ overall physical activity levels have improved,  both in exercise volume and intensity
* From Season 4 to Season 5, there were 7% more participants who engaged in the recommended 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week

### How You Can Participate:

Eligible participants can collect a HPB Fitness Tracker or use compatible fitness devices and pair these with the Healthy 365 app. Once done, users can clock steps and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes to earn rewards.
