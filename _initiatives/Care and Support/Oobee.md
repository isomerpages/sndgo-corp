[Oobee](https://go.gov.sg/oobee) (formerly Purple A11y) is an open-source accessibility tool that helps software development teams identify and fix accessibility issues in websites and applications, promoting a more inclusive digital experience for individuals with disabilities and seniors.

As of November 2024, Oobee has scanned over 810,000 pages and detected more than 11.9 million accessibility bugs. This includes checking colour contrast to ensure legibility for users with visual impairments and verifying that websites have adequate time-out limits so users with motor impairments can complete online transactions.
