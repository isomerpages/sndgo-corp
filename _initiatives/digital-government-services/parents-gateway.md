# Gateway to Better Parent–School Communication
![Parents Gateway app screen shots](/images/initiatives/Parent-gateway-screenshots.jpeg)


Parents, are you tired of trying to keep track of the information and consent forms sent by your child’s school? We hear you.
 
Parents Gateway is an app for schools to disseminate information, and seek parents’ consent on admin matters, in a consolidated digital form. It gives you greater access and control over your child’s participation in school activities and for you to better manage school-related administrative tasks.

It also frees up time and reduces the administrative workload for teachers, allowing them to focus on teaching and nurturing your child.


#### Designed in Collaboration

The app  is the result of close collaboration between various Government divisions and agencies, built with feedback from parents and teachers. 

User behaviour and needs were taken into consideration and applied to the final design. For instance, it has a calendar and in-app notifications to alert parents of information they need to know about. 

It is also regularly reviewed and refined to take into account the changing needs in the education landscape. 

#### How to Use the Parents Gateway App

The app gives parents direct access to administrative matters, allowing them to: 

* Provide consent for their child’s  participation in school activities

* Receive updates on programmes and activities their child is involved in
 
* Review changes in their child’s particulars when they change levels or schools
 
* Access administrative information for all their children even if they attend different schools

Teachers benefit too. The app reduces the need to distribute, collect and collate hardcopy admin forms, freeing up time for them to focus on lesson preparation and student engagement. 

#### In the Pipeline...

Parents will soon be able to check the balance of their child’s Edusave account, making sure they have sufficient funds before giving consent to activities. Our developers are also working on an online reservation system  for parent-teacher meetings.
