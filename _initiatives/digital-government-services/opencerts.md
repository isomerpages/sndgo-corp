# Graduate with a Digital Academic Certificate 

[OpenCerts](https://opencerts.io/ ) is a blockchain[^1] platform with a unique benefit: It offers an easy, reliable way for schools to issue and validate tamper-resistant digital academic certificates to students.

Developed by the Government Technology Agency, Ministry of Education, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and SkillsFuture Singapore, OpenCerts is built on open-source standards.

**Benefits of Digital Academic Certificates**

Students can receive their academic certificates and transcripts digitally, which can also be viewed, shared and verified internationally. With OpenCerts, the authenticity of each digital certificate can be trusted, thus reducing costs, time and effort to verify.

Education institutions can choose to publish these certificates on a public ledger for even easier verification.

**Why Blockchain?**

Blockchain offers us a tool for a new way of digitally recording transactions. A public blockchain is not owned or maintained by any one person. In other words, it is decentralised. This means all records made on the blockchain cannot be altered or destroyed by any single person. 

Since OpenCerts is built on a blockchain platform, its certificates are easily verifiable and cannot be destroyed.

When an OpenCerts certificate is issued by an educational institute, a unique code is published onto the blockchain. A cryptographic proof is added to the certificate data and sent to each student. This cryptographic proof allows OpenCerts to prove it has verified and validated the certificate.

[^1]: Blockchain is a tool for digitally recording transactions, be it between a buyer and seller, or in this case, an educational institution and its graduates. A public blockchain is neither owned nor maintained by an individual and instead decentralised. This ensures that records made on it cannot be altered or destroyed by a single person.

[^2]: A cryptographic proof is a method by which one party can prove to another party that they know a value of the proof without being aware of any other details within the documentation.
