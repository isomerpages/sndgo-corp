[SGQR](https://www.mas.gov.sg/development/e-payments/sgqr) is a single standardised QR code for e-payments and combines multiple payment schemes into a single SGQR label. Consumers just need to look out for the SGQR label to see which payment options a merchant accepts, while merchants only need to display one SGQR label instead of many labels. The SGQR scheme is co-owned by MAS and IMDA.
