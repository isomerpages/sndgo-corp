[PayNow](https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/pay-now) offers an enhanced funds transfer experience that enables retail customers of the participating banks and NFIs to send and receive Singapore Dollar funds from one bank or e-wallet account to another in Singapore through FAST by using just their mobile number, Singapore NRIC/FIN, or Virtual Payment Address (VPA), instantly. The sender no longer needs to know the recipientâ€™s bank/e-wallet provider and account number when transferring money via PayNow.
