# Innovation at the Heart of our Economy
![Data innovation programme office](/images/initiatives/DIPO.jpg)

Data is a precious asset with the potential to inspire innovation that can transform our startup and business landscape. As our Digital Economy becomes more seamless and connected, there is a need for a structured, transparent and flexible ecosystem for data-sharing and collaboration.

In Singapore, the Data Innovation Programme Office (DIPO) helps to facilitate this through industry-led Data Collaboratives. These collaboratives offer a stable, well-regulated sandbox to support innovation in the industry.

## Data Collaboratives Programme (DCP)

IMDA, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and DEX, a Singapore-based startup, participated in the first Data Collaborative pilot in April 2018. The shared aim was to build a decentralised, well-regulated and audited platform that data owners can trust.

Based off this six-month pilot, IMDA has since set up the [Data Collaboratives Programme](https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/data-collaborative-programme) in consultation with Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). The programme includes a [Trusted Data Sharing Framework](https://www.imda.gov.sg/news-and-events/Media-Room/Media-Releases/2019/Enabling-Data-Driven-Innovation-Through-Trusted-Data-Sharing-In-A-Digital-Economy) and data regulatory sandbox to help businesses share data in a safe, meaningful way.

If your business is looking to make use of the regulatory sandbox, key considerations include:

* **Innovativeness of ideas:** You should be able to demonstrate how you intend to use data to derive new value or creation of new products, which would not be possible under the current regulation  
* **Benefits to the public**: You should be looking to innovate and create products that will bring positive impact to consumers  
* **Ready and concrete use case:** Your plans should have sufficient interest from relevant stakeholders and have clear outcomes 
* **Risks assessment and mitigation:** Risks and impacts should be assessed and mitigated, with effort to safeguard the interests of the individual
