# Pushing Boundaries with Singapore’s Very Own FinTech Sandbox
![Singapore's central business district](/images/initiatives/Fintech-sandbox.jpg)

Financial technology, or FinTech, is evolving quickly and changing the way business is and will be done. As one of the world’s financial hubs, Singapore will have to keep pace with these changes, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has this in mind as it develops a Smart Financial Centre.

## FinTech Initiatives

The Smart Financial Centre will offer our financial institutions a space to experiment with new technologies to increase efficiency and better manage risks as they grow and innovate. This Centre will provide the facilities and infrastructure to keep us on top of the latest FinTech developments.

Here are some of the initiatives happening at the Smart Financial Centre:

### Looking Glass @ MAS

The [FinTech Innovation Lab](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2016/mas-establishes-fintech-innovation-lab) serves as a platform for the FinTech community to connect, collaborate, and co-create with one another in an engaging and supportive environment. 


-   **"Regulatory Sandbox"**

To provide a conducive environment for FinTech experiments and allow innovations a better chance to take root, the MAS is taking on a responsive and forward-looking regulatory approach.

It released a consultation paper on proposed guidelines for a “regulatory sandbox” that will enable financial institutions and non-financial players to experiment with FinTech solutions.

In November, MAS issued the [](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2016/mas-issues-regulatory-sandbox-guidelines-for-fintech-experiments) ["Regulatory Sandbox" guidelines](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2016/mas-issues-regulatory-sandbox-guidelines-for-fintech-experiments) for FinTech experiments.

-   **One-stop virtual entity for FinTech matters**

Plans are in place to set up a one-stop virtual entity for all FinTech related matters and to promote Singapore as a FinTech hub. Members of the office include MAS, Economic Development Board of Singapore, Infocomm Investments Pte Ltd, Info-communications Media Development Authority, National Research Foundation, and SPRING Singapore.

-   **Open data**

To encourage and facilitate development of innovative solutions, MAS published 12 sets of data from the MAS' Monthly Statistical Bulletin as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on their  [website](http://www.mas.gov.sg/Statistics/APIs.aspx).
