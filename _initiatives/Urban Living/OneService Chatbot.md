# AI-powered Chatbot for easy reporting of municipal issues

![OneService](/images/initiatives/overview-pages/oneservice_chatbot.jpg)

The OneService Chatbot is a project under the [National AI Strategy](/initiatives/artificial-intelligence) that supports ongoing improvements in the responsiveness of municipal service delivery. 

The Chatbot allows residents to easily report municipal issues on the go via WhatsApp and Telegram. The Chatbot guides the residents to provide the relevant information, in real-time conversational manner, to ensure that the feedback is comprehensively logged. The feedback will be automatically routed to the agency-in-charge of the issue based on text, geo-location and images submitted by the resident.
