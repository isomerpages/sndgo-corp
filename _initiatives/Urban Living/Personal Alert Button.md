PAB is an alert device that can be installed in an elderly’s home. When a senior in distress activates the PAB, a distress signal will be sent to either a&nbsp;[Senior Activity Centre (SAC)](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medical-and-care-facilities/8/senior_activity_centre)&nbsp;or&nbsp;[CareLine](https://www.singhealth.com.sg/rhs/live-well/CareLine/about-us), which is a 24-hour telecare service provided by Changi General Hospital (CGH).

Upon receiving a distress alert from the PAB, staff will triage the situation and respond accordingly. The staff may communicate with the distressed senior using the PAB’s 4G technology which enables two-way communication, or use a 10 second audio recording to triage the situation within the household.

As of August 2022, PABs have been installed in more than 6,000 units across 36 blocks. Between November 2019 and September 2021, the installed PABs handled 415 emergency cases, including medical, social, and crime-related issues.
