# Survey Drones to Tackle Dengue

![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/initiatives/drone-with-camera-for-dengue-survey.jpg)

Our region’s year-round warm climate and high humidity are ideal for the Aedes mosquito to breed rapidly. It has adapted particularly well to Singapore’s urban environment, where it likes to breed, mate and feed in our residential areas.

Currently, there are four dengue variants in Singapore and the country’s aim is to manage transmission and outbreak levels to be at a low and predictable rate. And technology is being used to protect our people against this longstanding health risk.

#### Using Drones

Roof gutters that are maintained less regularly tend to collect stagnant water, which leads to mosquito breeding grounds. As these are often located at a considerable height, they are difficult to access safely using traditional means.

Our tech solution: Drones. 

Drones not only allow us to survey roof gutters easily, they can also be equipped to dispense larvicide to effectively eradicate mosquito breeding habitats.
