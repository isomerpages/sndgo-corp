The OneService App is a one-stop platform that lets citizens feedback on municipal issues without having to figure out which Government agency or town council to contact. 

This is made possible by adopting an issue-based approach at the backend, so the reported case gets directed to the relevant agencies or town council. 

There are more than 350,000 users on the OneService app as of May 31, 2021. More than 250,000 cases were reported in 2020. For cases involving more than one Government agency, 90% of the cases were closed within 10.2 working days – down from 19.2 days when the app was launched in 2015. 

**Why Use OneService?**

* Easily interact with Government agencies and town councils to provide feedback on municipal issues to improve our living environment

* Receive alerts on home renovations near you
 
* Receive alerts when you are near a dengue cluster, so that you can take steps to protect yourself from potential dengue transmission
