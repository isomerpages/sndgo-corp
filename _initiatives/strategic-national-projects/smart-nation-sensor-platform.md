# Using Data to Build a Better Future

In this digital age, weâ€™re surrounded by huge amounts of data. The question is how we can organise and tap on the most relevant data,  to plan and develop better solutions that will improve the way we live in our city. 

The answer lies in our Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP). This is an integrated, nationwide platform that uses sensors to collect essential data that can be analysed to create smart solutions. 

Read on to find out how: 

**Tracking Water Usage and Leaks**

At the end of 2018, we completed a wireless sensor network trial to collect water data transmitted from smart meters from more than 500 sensors in Yuhua estate. The results showed that these smart meters can help homeowners save water by providing near real-time water usage data and detect water leaks via a mobile app.

 An earlier trial held in Punggol in 2016 showed similarly encouraging results. This time, households managed to achieve approximately 5% water savings from early leak detection and good water-saving habits.
 
 **Drowning Detection System at Public Pools**

We are conducting a pilot at our public swimming pools to use computer vision to detect possible drowning incidents.  The system helps to alert lifeguards so they can react faster to swimmers in distress and those in need.

**Personal Alert Button for Elderly**

As of April 2021, more than 5,600 seniors who live in rental blocks now have the Personal Alert Button (PAB) installed in their flats. This allows them to request for emergency help if needed.  

When the PAB is triggered, an alert will be sent to a Senior Activity Centre where staff can quickly assess the situation. With the two-way voice communication system,  help can then be dispatched to the unit quickly.

**Smart Lamp Posts for Urban Planning**

We started the Lamppost-as-a-Platform  trial in 2019 by placing sensors on lamp posts to collect data on air quality, rainfall and footfall. The data collected is  used for effective urban planning such as designing safer footpaths and roads for pedestrians. 

We also plan to collect environmental data to learn how we are being affected by global warming.
