Electronic payments (E-payments) are today simple, swift, seamless and secure digital transactions. As we move towards more of such transactions, e-payments will increasingly become a vital mode of payment for everyone - citizens and businesses alike.

## The Journey So Far

Here’s a quick look at some of the milestones so far:
