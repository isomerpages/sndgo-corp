# Sharing Resources to Develop Digital Services For Citizens 

Core Operations Development Environment and eXchange (CODEX) is a shared digital platform between government agencies and private sectors to develop better, faster and more cost-effective digital services. 

CODEX comprises:

* **A Government Data Architecture** for common standards and formats to enable agencies to share data.
* **Shifting less sensitive government systems and data to commercial cloud services** and tapping on these resources to better develop digital services.
* **A Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS)** that includes a suite of shared software components and infrastructure to enable more efficient and focused building of digital applications.

## How CODEX Makes a Difference

CODEX is scalable and reliable. It offers an easy way for the public and private sectors to share reusable digital components, including machine-readable data, middleware and microservices. 

Having these common tools and standards in place helps to reduce bugs and raise the quality and security of services.

Through CODEX, developers have many opportunities to explore and build new products and services that can greatly improve the way we transact and communicate with the Government, businesses, and each other.
