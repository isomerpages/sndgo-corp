As more Government services shift online, it is crucial we have a secure and easily accessible digital ecosystem in place. 

Singpass, the National Digital Identity (NDI) initiative, provides a convenient and secure platform for users - both citizens and businesses - to transact with the Government and other private service providers. 

Read on to learn more about the current suite of services.

## Singpass App

Launched in 2003, Singpass is a personal authentication system that allows users to access various Government services online. Users can log in to digital services conveniently and securely through the Singpass app using their fingerprint, facial recognition or a 6-digit passcode.  Singpass app also introduced two-factor authentication (2FA) methods like Singpass Face Verification and Multi-User SMS 2FA, on top of SMS one-time password (OTP). These provide an additional layer of security to better protect our users’ personal data and allow people to transact anywhere, anytime.

We have been progressively adding useful features to the Singpass app for simpler everyday transactions. Current features include:
* One-tap access to commonly-used Government digital services such as checking one's CPF balance, applying for an HDB flat, performing Internet banking, or managing insurance policies more easily
* Convenient access to one's digital IC 
* Timely notifications from Government agencies for alerts such as NRIC re-registration or passport renewal via the inbox feature
* Digital signing of documents by scanning a QR code. This removes the need for users to be physically present to sign documents and agreements

## MyInfo
A tell-us-once service that autofills selected personal details for online forms, minimising the need for users to repeatedly provide and verify the same information when transacting with Government agencies online. By tapping on the Retrieve MyInfo button, the participating digital service will be able to retrieve the necessary data fields needed with consent.

As an extension of this service, MyInfo Business enables  digital forms to be autofilled with data from Government sources such as corporate profile, financial performance and ownership information. The service has also been extended to private-sector services like opening of a corporate utilities account and applying for SME loans.

## Login

Businesses can tap on Login for authentication processes and customers can do away with remembering an additional set of credentials. To date, there are more than 50 private-sector organisations leveraging Login as an authentication gateway. These include OCBC Bank, Prudential, NTUC Union, Income Insurance, Singapore Exchange, the Singapore Employers’ Federation and JustLogin’s HR software.
