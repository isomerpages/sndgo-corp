Imagine a business park, university and community facilities conveniently located next to each other in one digital district. Sounds great, doesn’t it?

Welcome to <a href="https://estates.jtc.gov.sg/pdd" target="_blank">Punggol Digital District (PDD)</a>, Singapore’s highly-anticipated “smart district” that brings together industry and academia with the wider community to foster a vibrant, strong digital community!

## Integrated Master Plan

PDD is designed with an integrated master plan to encourage innovative interaction that can lead to creative ideas and solutions for the community and industry. At the heart of this plan is the intention to bring academia, industry and community together to create a “smart” space to live, work and play.

### Academia meets industry

Singapore Institute of Technology’s (SIT) new campus is located next to JTC’s business park buildings, facilitating greater industry-academia interaction.

This collaborative environment hopes to encourage students and professionals to pursue new, innovative ideas that can be readily prototyped, tested and adopted by businesses in PDD as well.

### Business meets community

The district is shaping up to become a groundswell of ideas and opportunities for businesses and the community to thrive.

PDD will house key growth sectors and businesses driving the Digital Economy, such as cybersecurity and the Internet of Things. This is expected to bring approximately 28,000 exciting jobs to Punggol and the north-east region.

Of course, it’s not just about business and the economy. A thriving community of people will also be calling this neighbourhood home. With shared public spaces and hi-tech community facilities, PDD will be connected to the Punggol waterfront by green links for the community’s recreational needs.
