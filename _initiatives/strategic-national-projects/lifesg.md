![LifeSG banner](/images/initiatives/lifesg-kv.jpg)

Originally known as Moments of Life, the <a href="http://www.life.gov.sg" target="_blank">app</a> was launched in June 2018, with modules to support families with young children, and seniors . The app was rebranded to LifeSG in August 2020, with new features to serve Singaporeans throughout their life journey.

Today, LifeSG allows you to easily access Government services, keep up with the latest news and updates, track your applications and more.

Below are some of LifeSG’s key features:

## Navigate Various Services

Ever felt overwhelmed when trying to get to a specific service? LifeSG helps connect you to more than 40 government services easily and at your fingertips.Information is grouped according to topics of interest, such as family and parenting, work and employment, healthcare and housing and property – making it easier to navigate. More services will be added progressively too, so watch out for these.

## Create A Personal Dashboard

Set up and create your personalised dashboard using MyInfo so that you receive the information you need. You can also browse recommended content, useful guides and Government benefits via features like the Family Support Calculator.

## Data Protection and Safeguards

LifeSG complies with the Public Sector Governance Act (PSGA), which governs data-sharing and protection within the public sector. It has the following technical safeguards in place to keep your information secure:

* Encrypting all data transmissions
* Mandating Singpass log-in as a requirement to access services
* Checking for unauthorised logins
* Running the platform through regular industry standard tests
