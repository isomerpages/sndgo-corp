# Guard against scammers with ScamShield

![ScamShield](/images/initiatives/overview-pages/scamshield-overview.jpg)

[ScamShield](https://www.scamshield.org.sg/) is a product suite that defends against scams, and was developed by Open Government Products in collaboration with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC).

## ScamShield App

The ScamShield App detects scam calls by cross-referencing unknown numbers with a database maintained by the Singapore Police Force. If ScamShield identifies the number as associated with scams, it will be automatically blocked. For incoming SMSes from non-saved contacts, ScamShield employs an on-device algorithm to assess whether the message is a scam.

The ScamShield mobile app has 3 main features: 

*   Automatically blocks scam calls
*   Automatically detects scam messages
*   Allows users to report scam messages and calls

## ScamShield Bot

The ScamShield Bot was developed to increase ease of reporting scams and to help users identify scams. With scams increasingly migrating to 3rd party platforms like WhatsApp, the ScamShield Bot on WhatsApp makes it easy for users to simply forward scam messages received on WhatsApp, or from any other 3rd party platform, and report them to the Singapore Police Force.

The ScamShield Bot has 2 core features: 

*   Check if a message or a call is a scam
*   Report scams to the Singapore Police Force
