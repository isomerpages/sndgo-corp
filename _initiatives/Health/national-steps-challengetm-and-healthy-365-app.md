![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/initiatives/Healthy-365.jpg)

The [National Steps Challenge™](https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/37/nsc) is the world’s first population level, fitness tracker-based physical activity initiative that encourages Singaporeans to move more. 

By leveraging behavioural insights and technology, the Challenge encourages Singaporeans to take more steps and clock moderate-to-vigorous physical activities daily as part of their everyday lives. They do so using a fitness tracker and the Healthy 365 mobile application.

It also rewards them when they reach different physical activity milestones. Participants can look forward to exciting sub-challenges and thematic challenges – all geared towards making moving more fun.
