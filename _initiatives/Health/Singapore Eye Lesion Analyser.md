[Singapore Eye Lesion Analyser (SELENA+)](https://www.synapxe.sg/healthtech/health-ai/selena/#atglance) is a deep-learning AI software system that can detect potential threatening eye conditions accurately and efficiently. It can detect abnormal fundus images, and in particular, signs of diabetic retinopathy disease. 

The use of SELENA+ to augment the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Programme (SiDRP) will potentially reduce the workload by up to 50 per cent, with patient results made available in minutes instead of hours or days. This enables resources to be optimised to support other areas such as formulating personalised care plans for patients.
