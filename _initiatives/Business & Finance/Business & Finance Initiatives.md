# Business & Finance Initiatives

Businesses have a unique opportunity to grow and thrive in Singapore’s Digital Economy due to our competitive advantages. Not only are we well-connected to other major Asian economies, we have also built up an excellent infrastructure and access to technology, on top of a well-educated workforce. Beyond this, we’re looking to solve real-world problems and companies can use Singapore as a testbed, before bringing these to other markets.

Learn how our business initiatives are helping companies here stay vibrant and competitive.
