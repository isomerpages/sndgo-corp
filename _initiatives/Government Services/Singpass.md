As more government services shift online, we must have a secure and easily accessible digital ecosystem. 

Launched in 2003, Singpass is a personal authentication system that enables users to access various services online. Today, Singpass is every Singapore resident’s trusted digital identity to prove who we are when performing everyday transactions like checking our CPF balance, booking medical appointments, renewing insurance, and more. Citizens and businesses can transact with the Government and private sector service providers across thousands of services, anytime, anywhere.

Singpass employs Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) methods, such as the Singpass app, Face Verification and SMS One-Time Passwords (OTP), to provide an additional layer of security and better protect users’ data.

## Singpass App

Since 2018, users can log in to digital services conveniently and securely through the Singpass mobile application using their fingerprint, face, or six-digit passcode.

We have progressively added useful features to the Singpass app for simpler everyday transactions. Current app features include:
* Digital IC to prove your identity over government counters
*   One-tap access to commonly used government digital services such as checking one’s CPF balance, applying for an HDB flat, and tax filing
*   Have your important information like CPF balance, passport number, and HDB details on hand
*   Receive timely notifications from Singpass, such as announcements, transactional alerts and security advisories
*   Digitally sign documents by scanning a QR code and authenticating on the app

## Access to Participating Private Sector Services

Businesses can leverage Singpass for authentication processes, and customers can do away with remembering an additional set of credentials. To date, more than 50 private sector organisations use Singpass to authenticate their customers. These include OCBC Bank, Prudential, NTUC Union, Income Insurance, Singapore Exchange, the Singapore Employers’ Federation, and JustLogin’s HR software.

## Pre-fill Forms with your Government Data

Users can also choose to autofill selected personal details for online forms by authenticating with Singpass and consenting to the participating digital service retrieving the necessary data fields. This minimises the need for users to repeatedly provide and verify the same information when transacting with the Government and participating service providers.

As an extension of this service, digital forms can also be auto-filled with corporate data from government sources, such as corporate profile, financial performance and ownership information. The service has also been extended to private-sector services like opening a corporate utilities account and applying for SME loans.
