# Tech that Speaks Your Language

Since 2018, we have enhanced access to commonly used Government digital services by offering them in multiple languages, including Malay, Mandarin and Tamil. These include the Singpass app, which is used to access various government digital services, popular communication channels like Gov.sg WhatsApp, and selected government websites.

Here are some tasks that can now be done in the four languages:

* Schedule appointments for vaccinations and health screenings using the [Health Appointment System (HAS)](https://book.health.gov.sg/).

* Find information about support programmes on the [Support Go Where website](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/).

* Learn how seniors can acquire essential digital skills and knowledge through the [Seniors Go Digital Programme](https://www.imda.gov.sg/en/seniorsgodigital) by Infocomm Media Development Authority. 

* Apply for the installation of grab bars, slip-resistant treatment, and ramps for seniors at home through the Housing and Development Board's [Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/ease).
