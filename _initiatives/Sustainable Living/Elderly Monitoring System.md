# Elderly Monitoring System

The Elderly Monitoring System provides families with greater peace of mind over the well-being and safety of elderly relatives, especially if they are living alone at home. 

The system learns the daily habits of seniors through the help of motion sensors and alerts you or other caregivers in times of need or when irregular patterns in behavior are detected (e.g. if no movement is detected for a period of time).
