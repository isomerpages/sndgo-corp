<summary>About</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The spread of harmful online content poses growing risks to society, from
falsehoods that distort public understanding to racially and religiously
divisive narratives and viral trends that endanger vulnerable groups. Tackling
these challenges requires prevention at the source, early detection at
scale, and public empowerment for effective mitigation. &nbsp;In this talk,
Dr. Yang Yinping, Centre Director of the Centre for Advanced Technologies
in Online Safety (CATOS), will outline the centre’s focal areas in tackling
harmful online content and how deep tech and translational research are
driving solutions in collaboration with public agencies, universities,
and industry partners. The session will highlight Singapore’s strategic
approach to digital resilience and include a live demonstration of technologies
from the first version of CATOS’ OTS Toolkit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dr. Joshua Uyheng, an Assistant Professor at Ateneo de Manila University
with a Ph.D. in Societal Computing from Carnegie Mellon University, will
further explore the bidirectional impact of online harms and real-world
events, drawing from studies on the Covid-19 pandemic. He will discuss
how offline instability fuels online hate and misinformation, while harmful
online narratives, in turn, shape real-world behaviors. His findings highlight
the need for effective platform regulation, public communication strategies,
and cross-sector collaboration to strengthen resilience against social
cyber harms.</p>

<p><strong>Demo 1: DesCartes Augmented 3D-Printed Marina Bay Twin Model</strong>
</p>
<p>This mixed-reality demo, featuring a scaled-down 3D-printed model of the
Marina Bay Sands district, allows participants to experience the adaptive
trajectory of a drone in downtown Singapore in real time, under varying
conditions such as wind, temperature, and pollution.</p>
<p><strong>Demo 2: DesCartes Hybrid Digital Twins</strong>
</p>
<p>Using an interactive table specifically designed for decision-making,
along with Hololenses, participants can interact with the digital twin
of Marina Bay district. In real time, they can understand and visualize
how different conditions (wind, temperature, pollution, no-fly zones, etc.)
impact these neighbourhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Demo 3: Boid Corner Interactive Installation</strong>
</p>
<p>Drawing on both the Singaporean tradition of Birds Corners and the pioneering
artificial life/swarm AI programs (‘Boid’ as bird-like object), this interactive,
thought-provoking installation tracks visitors’ hand poses and turns them
into virtual wings/birds, while visualising and extrapolating data. By
experimenting with playful interactions and data visualizations, the aim
is to make the visitors of the installation reflect on some of the critical
issues at stake when it comes to AI, data collection, biometric identifiers,
human digital twins and the use of technology in public spaces.</p>

<p><strong>16:15 - 16:25</strong>: Cambridge CARES Presentation</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>16:25 - 16:45</strong>: AI-Driven Discovery of Metal-Organic Polyhedra
for Sustainable Applications</p>
<p>We present an integrated computational framework for the exploration,
design, and synthesis of Metal-Organic Polyhedra (MOPs). Using the OntoMOPs
ontology and assembly models (AMs), we rationally designed 1,418 novel
MOP structures from 151 known examples, streamlining the selection of lab-ready
candidates. We developed an automated structural modelling tool that generates
atomic-scale MOP models using geometric data and predefined motifs, validated
against experimental data and integrated into The World Avatar for high-throughput
screening. Additionally, we introduced “Marie”, a semantic AI agent powered
by GPT-4o-mini, which interprets natural language queries and provides
access to existing and newly designed MOPs, along with their measured or
predicted geometric properties.&nbsp; We have also developed a separate
large language model-based agent that extracts synthesis information from
literature and adds it to MOP instances in the knowledge graph, enabling
the generation of structured synthesis protocols or trends in parameters.
This framework bridges theoretical design and experimental practice, advancing
autonomous material discovery pipelines for applications of choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>16:45 - 17:05</strong>: Digital Lab Framework powered by The World
Avatar</p>
<p>We introduce a unified framework for automating laboratory management
and enabling distributed self-driving laboratories (SDLs) via The World
Avatar. By integrating ontologies, RFID/QR technologies, mobile applications,
and autonomous agents, the Digital Laboratory Framework (DLF) addresses
lab management challenges such as hazardous chemical tracking and asset
management while facilitating collaborative closed-loop optimisation across
geographically dispersed labs. Demonstrated applications include an automated
explosive chemical tracking system and a mobile asset management app, alongside
real-time, multi-objective reaction optimisation by robots in Cambridge
and Singapore. This approach enhances productivity, reduces human error,
ensures FAIR data practices, and lays the foundation for a globally interconnected
network of SDLs, advancing scalable, modular lab automation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A*STAR Distinguished Lecture: NLP is Dead, Long Live NLP by <strong><em>A*STAR</em></strong>
</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion-group isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>About</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Large language models with multi-tasking capabilities have emerged in
the last several years and made traditional NLP tasks, such as ASR, machine
translation, summarization, text generation, sentiment analysis, as well
as intermedia NLP tasks such as POS tagging, parsing, named entity recognition,
textual entailment, etc.,&nbsp; obsolete. It is fair to say that the field
of NLP, as defined by these tasks, is dead. It is also evident in conferences
such as&nbsp; ACL and EMNLP where the vast majority of work is based on
some form of LLM pre-training or post-training. Indeed, LLM research has
both expanded beyond traditional NLP areas and replaced the latter. Quo
Vadis NLP?</p>
<p>In this talk, I argue that, following LLMs, language research is more
relevant than ever. The emergence of agentic systems marks a new milestone
in human-machine interactions.&nbsp; I propose a new framework of language
research that looks into mental world modeling, which parallels physical
world modeling. Language both represents and shapes the “mental world models”
of humans, enabling us to reason, plan, emote, learn, innovate and create.
Natural language research, therefore, should endeavor to come up with better
and more efficient mental world models than current LLMs. The scope of
“language” should expand to include non-iconographic languages such as
gesture and music.&nbsp; NLP research can thrive again, leading to new
innovations in AI.</p>

<p>As part of MDDI’s AI Research Week, the National Robotics Programme (NRP)
would be hosting an Embodied AI workshop on 29 April 2025 at NUS LT18.
The workshop will discuss the state of the art for embodied AI, present
current research by Singapore institutes, and discuss potential developments
in the technology. We also hope to inspire further collaborations for embodied
AI in Singapore from this workshop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The workshop will feature local researchers who have contributed
to robotics technologies and are now working to bring AI capabilities to
robotics. Invited speakers include Dr Kenneth Kwok (IHPC), Dr Cheston Tan
(I2R), Professor Harold Soh (NUS), Assistant Professor Yan Jianfei (NTU),
and Assistant Professor Soujanya Poria (SUTD).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The National Robotics Programme (NRP) is a national platform that
aims to catalyse differentiated robotics capabilities in Singapore through
the funding of use-inspired research and use-driven development. NRP leverages
its projects to grow Singapore’s robotics talent pool and nurture a vibrant
local ecosystem.</p>
