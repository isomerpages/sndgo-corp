As a Smart Nation, our commitment extends beyond merely embracing technology; we aspire to be at the forefront, setting the pace, and driving global innovation and conversations in tech, including AI. 

In 2019, we unveiled our first National AI Strategy, outlining plans to deepen the use of AI to transform our economy. Our early investment in AI led to the establishment of about 150 teams working on research and development, and 900 startups exploring new ideas with AI. Since then, we've witnessed significant breakthroughs in AI, resulting in the development of new products, enhanced capabilities, and transformative interactions. 

In 2023, we launched the **Singapore National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0**) in our ongoing pursuit of setting the pace.

## Singapore National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0)


To propel ourselves further as leaders in the field AI, three key shifts from our initial National AI Strategy are imperative for NAIS 2.0:

<br>

<div class="row">

<div class="col"> 
<img src="/images/initiatives/Nais/necessity.png" alt="Necessity">
<div style="font-size:18px;"><b><center>From Opportunity<br>to Necessity</center></b></div>
<div style="font-size:18px; line-height:32px">The expanded landscape of opportunities and risks brought forth by AI today make clear that AI is indispensable for the continued prosperity and relevance as a nation. We must master AI, rather than think of it merely as an accessory or a luxury.<br></div></div>

<div class="col"> 
<img src="/images/initiatives/Nais/global.png" alt="Global">
<div style="font-size:18px;"><b><center>From Local<br>to Global</center></b></div>
<div style="font-size:18px; line-height:32px">Singapore must operate, from the outset, with a global outlook for AI. We must connect to global networks, working with the best and pooling resources among the like-minded to overcome the complex challenges that plague AI today.<br></div></div>
	
<div class="col"> 
<img src="/images/initiatives/Nais/systems.png" alt="Systems">
<div style="font-size:18px;"><b><center>From Projects<br>to Systems</center></b></div>
<div style="font-size:18px; line-height:32px">We must further enhance our capability, infrastructure and resource foundations, and accelerate ideas exchange at scale, to amplify and manage the impact of AI across various sectors, and in economy and society at large.<br></div></div>

</div>


### Goals of NAIS 2.0
	
Guided by the vision “AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World”, NAIS 2.0 seeks to attain the twin goals of:

<br>

<div class="row">

<div class="col"> 
<img src="/images/initiatives/Nais/excellence.png" alt="Excellence">
<div style="font-size:18px;"><b><center>Excellence</center></b></div>
<div style="font-size:18px; line-height:32px">Singapore will selectively develop peaks of excellence in AI, to advance the field and maximise value creation. We intend to direct AI towards addressing the needs and challenges of our time, such as in areas of global importance like population health and climate change.<br></div></div>

<div class="col"> 
<img src="/images/initiatives/Nais/empower.png" alt="Empowerment">
<div style="font-size:18px;"><b><center>Empowerment</center></b></div>
<div style="font-size:18px; line-height:32px">Singapore will raise up individuals, businesses, and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment, and trust. We intend for AI to be the great equaliser, which equips our people and businesses with the capabilities and resources to thrive in an AI-enabled future.<br></div></div>

### Working through 10 Enablers to achieve our vision and goals

To achieve our vision and goals, we will direct efforts under NAIS 2.0 toward **3 Systems** working through **10 Enablers**.  Click on the image below to learn more about the **15 Actions** that Singapore will undertake across these systems and enablers, to support our ambitions over the next 3-5 years. We will continually review these Actions to respond to fast-moving developments in AI, across domains.
