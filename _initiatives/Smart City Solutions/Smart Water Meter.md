# Tracking Water Data

Collecting and analysing data on how we use water can go a long way towards helping us become more efficient with the precious resource. PUB, our national water agency, is progressively rolling out <a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/Public/KeyInitiatives/Smart-Water-Meter" target="_blank">smart water meters</a> to replace our current mechanical meters.

The smart water meters are designed to monitor, collect and make data on the use of water readily accessible for consumers via a web portal.
