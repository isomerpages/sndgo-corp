Developed by A*STAR’s Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) and Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB), the Integrated Environmental Modeller (IEM) is the first integrated and scalable tool to couple all key environmental physics and their complex interactions into a single simulation platform using the latest high performance computing technology.

With IEM, users will be able to visualise environmental features such as natural ventilation, air temperature, solar irradiance and noise levels on a virtual “Digital Twin” platform, which allows for efficient refinement to urban plans. The tool reduces the risk of costly physical trial-and-error and allows development plans to be tested computationally before actual implementation. It also provides quantitative and scientific assessments that let planners understand the different trade-offs involved to aid decision-making.
