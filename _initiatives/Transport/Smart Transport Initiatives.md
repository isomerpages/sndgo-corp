# Transport in a Smart Nation 
Currently, our Government has set aside 12% of our land area for roads and infrastructure. Considering our small land size, this is a significant percentage.

However, our growing population requires us to further optimise our limited space. With more than 1 million vehicles on the road and counting, we face the ongoing challenge of designing more efficient, safe and reliable transportation systems for Singapore. 

The initiatives below outline how we aim to achieve this.
