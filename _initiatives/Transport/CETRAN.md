Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) may be one for the future but getting them on our roads safely requires adequate testing and research today.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and JTC, in partnership with Nanyang Technological University (NTU), launched the Centre of Excellence for Testing & Research of AVs (CETRAN) in 2017. The Centre comes equipped with a 1.8ha test circuit for these road tests. As one of the world’s few SDV testing and research facilities, CETRAN places Singapore at the global forefront to develop international SDV standards as we test, certify, trial and deploy these vehicles on a large scale.

## How are tests conducted in CETRAN?

NTU will operate the CETRAN test circuit and evaluate SDV prototypes according to their ability to manoeuvre in local conditions such as:

*  Traffic rules
*  Traffic behaviour
*   Road design
*   Our tropical climate

An expert team will also perform tests in a computer-simulated environment representative of Singapore’s traffic conditions to complement the tests performed at CETRAN.
