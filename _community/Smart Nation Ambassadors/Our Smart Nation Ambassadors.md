# Transform Lives with Technology

Are you interested to help others improve their quality of life with the use of tech?  Volunteer as a Smart Nation Ambassador and help us help fellow Singaporeans get involved in the Smart Nation journey.

## Meet our Smart Nation Ambassadors

Since the Smart Nation Ambassadors programme was launched in January 2019, we’ve had about 4,000 volunteers helping the community embrace digital technologies to improve their lives.

Our Smart Nation Ambassadors bring different skills, expertise and experience that adds to our Smart Nation efforts. This meant sharing user tips with the public on digital government tools and services, curating lessons to help workers pick up tech skills, to helping project teams gather feedback to improve our offerings at roadshows, digital clinics and various engagement activities.

Each year, at every Smart Nation Ambassadors (SNAs) Appreciation Event, we take the opportunity to honour Star SNAs who have gone above and beyond in their roles as SNAs. Hear from our Star SNAs on what motivates them to volunteer.
