## OGP Open Jio Programme

![OGP Open Jio](/images/community/openjio/openjio_01.jpeg)

Open Government Products (OGP) started OGP Open Jio, a citizen engagement programme aimed to involve everyday citizens in the development of our products. By joining the program, citizens can help to represent people of their profile in interviews and test our products. With their feedback and ideas, we can improve the experience of our digital products for the benefit of all Singaporeans.

### How does this help build tech for public good?

Recently, participation has helped us to better understand and fight scams. From our ScamShield research, 24% of survey respondents and 68% of user interviews came from OGP Open Jio. OGP Open Jio not only got us the numbers we needed, but also helped us find citizens who are willing to spend time talking to us. This feedback helped us iterate for the next version of the ScamShield app!

### What can you expect?
