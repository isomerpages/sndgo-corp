# Transform Lives with Technology

![Smart Nation Ambassdors](/images/community/sna/SNA-smart-Nation-U.jpg)

Are you interested to help others improve their quality of life with the use of tech?  Volunteer as a Smart Nation Ambassador and help us help fellow Singaporeans get involved in the Smart Nation journey.

## Meet our Smart Nation Ambassadors

Since the Smart Nation Ambassadors (SNAs) programme was launched in January 2019, about 4,000[^1] volunteers have joined us to help the community embrace digital technologies to improve their lives.

Our Ambassadors are the ‘special sauce’ that make Smart Nation special. From poly students to retirees, from academics to techies – they are bound by a desire to bring their skills, expertise and experience to add to our Smart Nation effort. Their contributions can take many different shapes: sharing user tips with the public on digital government tools and services at roadshows; facilitating webinars on everyday apps; helping project teams gather user feedback.

 
Every year, we organise an event  to thank our wonderful Ambassadors, and also to give special mention to our Star SNAs, recognised for being our super volunteers. Find out what motivates them in the videos below:
