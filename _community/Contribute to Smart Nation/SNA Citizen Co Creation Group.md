## Smart Nation Ambassador Citizen Co-Creation Group (SNA CCG)

![SNA CCG](/images/community/ccg/snaccg_01.jpeg)

SNA CCG is designed to engage everyone, not just the “digitally-able” or majority groups.&nbsp;

Made up of community leaders from diverse groups, the SNA CCG helps to facilitate focus group discussions and dialogues with people of different needs and abilities. These groups include persons with disabilities, low-income families and seniors. Through these discussions and dialogues, we will be able to gather deeper insights on service journeys. Topics of discussion include Smart City solutions for the neighbourhood, and ways to address gaps on digital inclusion for low-income families and persons with disabilities.  
  
These community representatives also work with our engineering teams to co-develop tech solutions that tackle social and economic issues to foster greater co-ownership for our Smart Nation outcomes.

With the community’s participation and feedback in the development and user-testing of new digital products, we can continuously improve our services for a better user experience.
