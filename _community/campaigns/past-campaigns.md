![My Smart Ahma](/images/media-hub/smart-nation-archives/my-smart-ahma-logo.png)

Launched in 2018, My Smart Ahma web series told the story of our  Smart Nation initiatives through the vantage point of  Ahma (Grandma) and Benjamin as they discover how technology can benefit our daily lives. 

A series of webinars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmGkYf0auQJyDWGlxbnFyqBrq86C-zbow" target="_blank">(My Smart Ahma Top Picks)</a>, were also conducted to  help seniors join the digital transformation journey.  In each session, seniors got to use different apps.
