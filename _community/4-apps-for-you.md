          <h3>LifeSG</h3> 
          LifeSG is your one-stop personalised access to government services and information.<br>
          The App connects services to multiple websites into one App – saving you time and effort. When you set up your profile with MyInfo, you can personalise the App to show you what it interesting and important to you.  <br>
          LifeSG connects you to the right services and information. It is the easiest way to keep up with your government to-do list: schemes, benefits,                     applications, events and more.
