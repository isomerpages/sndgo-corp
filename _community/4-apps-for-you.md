	Gone are the days when one has to look for a store to buy parking coupons! We can now pay for parking conveniently using our mobile devices.<br>  
	<br>
	The App also calculates parking charges automatically - down to the minute. If you leave earlier, the balance will be refunded; no wasted minutes (or cash). The App will prompt when the parking session is about to expire so you can extend the session remotely. No more summons if you forget to add more parking coupons!<br>
