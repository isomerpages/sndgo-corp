Are you interested to help others improve their quality of life with the use of tech?  Volunteer as a Smart Nation Ambassador and help us help fellow Singaporeans get involved in the Smart Nation journey.

## Meet our Smart Nation Ambassadors

Since the Smart Nation Ambassadors programme was launched in January 2019, we’ve had more than1,600 volunteers helping people in the community to access Smart Nation and digital government services and initiatives at roadshows, engagement activities and digital clinics. 

Hear from our ambassadors -Alice, Jamberi, Pearlie and Saiful - on why they decided to serve the community in this way.
