## **Q1. Who are Smart Nation Ambassadors?**

Smart Nation Ambassadors (SNAs) are volunteers who support the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group’s co-creation efforts. They support us by engaging citizens on Smart Nation and digital government initiatives. 

SNAs can get involved in a variety of activities - from teaching someone how to use digital tools, or helping to collect feedback on digital government initiatives. As an SNA, your contribution will help build an inclusive Smart Nation, one in which people from all walks of life can benefit from  having their everyday lives enhanced with technology.

## **Q2. What skills do I need to become a Smart Nation Ambassador?**

We are looking for individuals with an interest in helping others live digitally-enabled lives. If you are digitally-savvy,  that would be be a plus. But it is not essential. We will organise briefings and training, depending on the type of volunteer programmes you sign up for. 

We will ensure you are equipped and trained to enable you to be a Smart Nation advocate!

### **Q3. What opportunities are open to me as a Smart Nation Ambassador?**

- SNAs co-create digital government services with the community through various platforms such as  [Smart Nation Co-creating with Our People Everywhere (SCOPE)](/community/scope) and Smart Nation builder. Co-creation involves understanding the community’s pain points and problem statements so that digital solutions can be built and tailored to meet their needs. SCOPE is a co-creation platform spearheaded by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group. It facilitates the testing of new digital government products in development, and gathers feedback from citizens. These insights help us to improve our digital government products and services. 

- SNAs helps guide public on the use of digital government solutions. These include demonstrating government apps, and helping public try out new technologies such as  sensor technology. For example, SNAs were at the Merdeka Generation Roadshows and Skillsfuture Festival to share with the public the benefits of apps like MyTransport.SG and Singpass Mobile, as well as demonstrate how to download and use them on their smartphones.

- SNAs lead and guide groups at events. At larger events such as Digital Inclusion Festival and Smart Nation & U, they act as event guides. They bring the interested public around on tours to event highlights and help guide the public through the various showcases on display.

- SNAs can teach others about technology. With [#Smart NationTogether](/community/webinars-for-everyone/), SNAs have curated an extensive list of live online programmes such as hands-on workshops to learn data analytics tools, lessons on using Zoom and Singpass Mobile, and even coding workshops and STEM classes for families with young children.

- SNAs can set up booths at Smart Nation events to provide hands-on experiences to the public. If you are a tech company or entrepreneur with an interesting solution, or have an idea to showcase, we welcome you to do so at our events! 
 
These are just some of the opportunities that you will be able to participate in. If you have ideas on how you can help others live, work and play in a Smart Nation, [email us](mailto:ambassadors@smartnation.gov.sg) and let us know!
