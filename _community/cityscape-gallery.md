Visitors to CityScape will learn about how technology:

*  supports the planning of towns and amenities;
*   is embedded into our infrastructure to benefit citizens and businesses;
*   helps attract technology companies and talent to Singapore, and secure Singapore’s place as a thought leader on Smart City innovations.
