# Smart Nation PlayScape

Smart Nation PlayScape is jointly developed by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group and [Science Centre Singapore](https://www.science.edu.sg/). It features a wide variety of digital technologies powering Singapore’s Smart Nation journey. 

Through gamified interactives, complex technological concepts are broken down and brought to life. People of all ages can experience and see the benefits that digitalisation has to offer.  
 
The exhibition consists of eight zones: Sensors, Geospatial, Biometrics, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Data Analytics, Robotics, User Experience (UX) & Services, and Augmented/Virtual Reality/Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR). Each zone includes key game interactives for guests to explore and experience these technologies in a fun and engaging way.
