To expose children to the benefits of technology in an innovative and engaging way, [TOUCH Community Services](https://www.touch.org.sg/), together with Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/meta/) and [MeshMinds](https://www.meshminds.com/) launched ‘My Favourite Days’, a 35-page Augmented Reality (AR) storybook centred on the heart-warming interaction between a little girl and her grandfather on a journey of discovery.

Young readers will get to stretch their imagination on the future career possibilities offered by technology and be inspired by a future where technology improves lives and opens up fresh opportunities in our work that we would not have imagined!
