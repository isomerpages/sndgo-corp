Are you passionate about technology and Smart Nation? Are you driven by the desire to create digital solutions that can transform our society, economy and government?

If your answer is yes and yes, come apply for the Smart Nation Scholarship. Offered by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (<a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/" target="_blank">CSA</a>), Government Technology Agency (<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/" target="_blank">GovTech</a>) and Infocomm Media Development Authority (<a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/" target="_blank">IMDA</a>), the scholarship is an opportunity for you to carve out a career in tech, while making meaningful contributions to improve the lives around you.

You can indicate or rank your preference of the three agencies. When offered, you can only accept one scholarship offer from the agency of your choice. During the course of your study, you will have internship opportunities with your sponsoring agency and possibly other organisations to experience the work culture and be exposed to challenging tech projects. Upon graduation, you will gain direct admission into a talent programme within your sponsoring agency for fast-tracked career development, where you will be groomed for leadership positions and take on key roles in national projects.
