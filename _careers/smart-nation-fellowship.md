Our journey to build a Smart Nation would not be possible without talented, creative and visionary individuals. 

Over the past years, we’ve had the privilege of working with bright, established professionals whom we are proud to call our Smart Nation Fellows. These Fellows work alongside GovTech project teams, sharing their experience and expertise towards developing tech for public good. 

You might be an experienced data scientist, engineer, applied researcher, or technologist.  Whatever your field of expertise, we welcome you to join the ranks of our Fellowship programme if you share our desire to create tech-related solutions that can positively impact our way of life in Singapore.
