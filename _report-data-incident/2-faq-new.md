							<label class="tab-label" for="chck2020_4">Why was The Star Theatre chosen as the Show venue?</label>
							<div class="tab-content"><p>We decided to move away from the Float as the revised NDP2020 show concept did not require mass performances in a large outdoor location. The NDP EXCO studied various options to assess their suitability to hold a Show that could fit the scale and concept that we wanted. The Star Theatre was chosen amongst other studio options as it was assessed to have the most suitable stage, technical equipment and supporting facilities. </p>

							<div class="tab-content"><p>Safety is our priority and we will work with various stakeholders such as the Town Councils to disseminate advisories ahead of National Day, to remind Singaporeans not to congregate in a large group. We will also have ambassadors on the ground to remind Singaporeans. Personnel from the SAF and Home Team will also be deployed on the ground for crowd control. </p>
