Rolling out digital services to help with the management and containment of the virus was essential. The services had to be implemented keeping in mind that we will have to live with COVID-19 over the next few years. With the following solutions, we believe we can boost community preparedness and confidence to manage and pull through this challenging time.

# HealthCerts

[HealthCerts](https://www.healthcerts.gov.sg/) was developed as a globally interoperable standard for COVID-19 test results and vaccinations certificates to facilitate the safe resumption of travel.

# Notarise & Verify System

The system endorses locally-issued COVID-19 test results and vaccination certificates and checks the authenticity of such certificates.

# National Appointment System (NAS) for COVID-19 Vaccination

To support the roll-out of nation-wide vaccinations, we created a [the National Appointment System (NAS) for COVID-19 Vaccination website](https://appointment.vaccine.gov.sg/) for residents to schedule their appointments once they receive their Registration Code. This efficient system helps to manage the appointments and administrative load ensures that the vaccination doses are sufficient and used with minimal wastage.

# Space Out

Launched in April 2020, [Space Out](https://www.spaceout.gov.sg/) enabled people to check crowd levels at various locations during the circuit breaker to promote safe distancing.

# SPOTON Smart Thermal Scanner

SPOTON enables faster crowd temperature scanning of up to ten people at a time. This scanner minimises physical contact, reduces manpower and speeds up check-ins to popular and high traffic locations.

For more information on SPOTON, head over to [GovTech's Developer Portal](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/spoton).

# SupplyAlly

[SupplyAlly](https://www.supplyally.gov.sg/) is a mobile app that facilitates the process of logistics distribution. It has been used for the distribution of masks, TraceTogether Tokens and various COVID-19 initiatives. SupplyAlly provides the logistical distribution support to ensure that all data and stock levels were captured accurately.

SupplyAlly has facilitated the management of hundreds of volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic, distribution of 4.2 million reusable masks, over $20 million in physical credit vouchers and the issuance of TraceTogether Tokens. The App continues to be used by charity organisations for food redemptions. 

# VigilantGantry

VigilantGantry is a fully automated AI-driven temperature screening gantry that saves time and manpower.

The AI-driven system can record temperatures even with headgear or hair fringes – avoiding any required human intervention! GovTech has open-sourced the solution for wider adoption in the public sector.
