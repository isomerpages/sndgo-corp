**Suggested new text:**

SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) Boxes are have been rolled out at public transport nodes for commuters to check in and check out. This provides commuters with another option to check in/check out with their TraceTogether App/Token, on top of existing SafeEntry QR codes, to support contact tracing efforts. Token users may also use the SEGW Box to check and ensure they have a working Token. 


The SEGW Boxes (check-in and check-out) are located near the Passenger Service counters at all MRT stations, bus interchanges and integrated transport hubs.
