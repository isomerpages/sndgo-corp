SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) Boxes have been rolled out at public transport nodes for commuters to perform their check-in/outs. These devices provide commuters with another option to check in and check out of the location with their TraceTogether App or Token, on top of existing SafeEntry QR codes, to support contact tracing efforts. 

Token users may also use the SEGW Box to check and ensure they have a working Token. 

The SEGW Boxes are located near the Passenger Service counters at all MRT stations, bus interchanges and integrated transport hubs.
