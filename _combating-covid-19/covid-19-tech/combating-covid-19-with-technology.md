#  Singapore’s Tech-Driven Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic

 ![COVID-19 technological solutions](/images/covid-19/COVID-19-tech-solutions.png)
 
COVID-19 is the crisis of our current generation. The pandemic has shut down entire cities, caused deficits in economies and put many lives on hold as people were ordered to mostly stay home to prevent the virus from spreading.

In Singapore, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group used technology to respond swiftly and effectively to the pandemic and keep our people safe. As we continue to fight COVID-19, find out how we’ve supported our public health response with technology.

## Contact-Tracing Tech
![COVID-19 contact tracing and management technology](/images/covid-19/COVID-19-contact-tracing-and-management.png)

When the pandemic hit Singapore, there was a real risk that high infection numbers would overload our healthcare system. Responding to this threat, we swiftly conceptualised and implemented digital contact tracing solutions such as TraceTogether (TT) and SafeEntry.

With the help of these contact tracing tools, we managed to reduce the average time to identify and quarantine close contacts of COVID-19-positive patients significantly.


### SafeEntry

[SafeEntry](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/) is our national digital check-in system that logs people's check-in/out records at most public locations where SafeEntry is mandatory. SafeEntry supports the contact tracing effort in the following ways:

* Automatically generating an activity map of COVID-19 cases, instead of relying on memory and recall
* Helping cases recall places they have visited, and jog their memories for more information
* Helping to identify users who have been to hotspots, and notifying them to get tested or to monitor their own health
* Working together with TraceTogether and other digital contact tracing tools to reduce the time taken to identify and quarantine close contacts

### TraceTogether Programme

The [TraceTogether Programme](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/) comprises the TraceTogether App (launched in March 2020) and TraceTogether Token (launched in June 2020). Both work by the exchange of Bluetooth signals to record the presence of other nearby TraceTogether devices.

TraceTogether helps to tackle the spread of the virus by identifying individuals who were in close proximity with a COVID-19 patient, which then allows health officials to take the appropriate quarantine measures to ring-fence possible exposures and limit the spread within the community.

Individuals can choose to either download the TT App on their mobile phones or use the TT Token. The latter ensures inclusivity for those who are less digitally savvy, or who prefer a separate device.

### Homer

The [Homer app](https://homer.gov.sg/) allows government agencies to easily contact and monitor the health status of people who are on Stay Home Notices (SHN) or Quarantine Orders (QO).

The app works by using an automatic location reporting function, which submits a person's current location to the relevant authorities multiple times a day. Individuals can also use the app to update their health status as required.

## Informational Websites and Platforms

![COVID-19 information websites and platforms](/images/covid-19/COVID-19-informational-platforms.png)

There’s a critical need to make sure the public can access verified and timely information during the pandemic. This would help provide public assurance that the COVID-19-related information is accurate and can be relied on, especially during times of panic or uncertainty.

These are reliable sources of information people can turn to at any time:


*  [COVID-19 Situation Report Dashboard](https://covidsitrep.moh.gov.sg/)  presents the key statistics and figures on Singapore's current pandemic situation.
*  [FluGoWhere](https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/) allows the public to find a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) closest to them to receive subsidised treatment and medication for respiratory infections. 
*  [Gov.sg WhatsApp](https://www.gov.sg/article/govsg-on-whatsapp) delivers daily COVID-19 updates to more than 1.2 million subscribers in their preferred language. It's also used for other key Government announcements, such as the annual Budget and National Day Rally.
*  [Gov.sg Info Bot](https://www.gov.sg/infobot) addresses public queries regarding COVID-19. As of December 2020, this bot has addressed more than 865,000 COVID-19-related queries. 
*  [TokenGoWhere](https://token.gowhere.gov.sg/) helps the public to check where they can collect or replace their Tokens.
*  [MaskGoWhere](https://mask.gowhere.gov.sg/) helped people find the nearest location to collect face masks distributed by the Government. [Read GovTech’s look-back](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/maskgowhere) on how we raced against time to get the website up and running.

## Public Health Solutions
![COVID-19 tech solutions](/images/covid-19/COVID-19-tech-solutions.png)

COVID-19 will likely be around for at least the next few years. Our arsenal of digital public health solutions will help boost community preparedness and confidence to continue fighting the virus. 

* [HealthCerts](https://www.healthcerts.gov.sg/) follows the global standard for COVID-19 test results and vaccination certificates to facilitate the safe resumption of travel.
* **Notarise & Verify System** endorses and checks the authenticity of locally issued COVID-19 test results and vaccination certificates.
* [National Appointment System (NAS) for COVID-19 Vaccination](https://appointment.vaccine.gov.sg/) allows the public to schedule their vaccination appointments once they receive the registration code.
*  [Space Out](https://www.spaceout.gov.sg/) allows users to check crowd levels at various locations, so they can better plan their activities and avoid crowded areas.
*  [SPOTON Smart Thermal Scanner](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/spoton) scans up to 10 people at a time, minimising physical contact and reducing manpower while speeding up check-ins at popular and high traffic locations.
*  **VigilantGantry** is a fully automated, AI-driven temperature-screening gantry that can record people's temperatures even if their fringes are blocking the forehead or they have headgear on.
*  [SupplyAlly](https://www.supplyally.gov.sg/) is an app that facilitates logistics distribution. It was used for the distribution of masks, TraceTogether Tokens, credit vouchers as well as the management of various other COVID-19 initiatives and volunteers.

## Providing Social and Economic Support

![COVID-19 social and economic support](/images/covid-19/COVID-19-economic-support.png)

Many different issues and concerns emerged as a result of the pandemic. People lost their jobs or had their salaries reduced. Students had to adapt to home-based learning when schools had to close. 

To support our citizens through these challenges, we quickly set up platforms and websites to share information, or for the application of COVID-19 grants:
* [COVID-19 GoBusiness portal:](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/) Provides businesses with information on safe management requirements and for them to apply to resume operations.
* **COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) application portal (closed in end 2020):** 98,000 grant applications for Singaporeans whose jobs were affected by COVID-19 were approved. CSG was replaced with the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) that had revised eligibility criteria.
* [COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) application portal:](https://msf-csg.gov.sg/preinstruction/crg) Supports workers from lower- to middle-income households who need temporary financial help to tide them over the loss of jobs due to COVID-19.
* [SupportGoWhere](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/): A LifeSG initiative, it lists information and enables citizens to check for COVID-19 assistance schemes they are eligible for.
* **Student Learning Space:** Helped 420,000 students and 33,000 teachers transition to home-based learning.
