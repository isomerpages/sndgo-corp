SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) Boxes have been rolled out at public transport nodes for commuters to perform their check-in/outs. These devices provide commuters with another option to record their entry and exit with their TraceTogether App or Token to support contact tracing efforts, on top of scanning the existing SafeEntry QR codes. 

Token users may also use the SEGW Box to check that they have a working Token. 

The SEGW Boxes are located near the Passenger Service counters at all MRT stations, bus interchanges and integrated transport hubs.
