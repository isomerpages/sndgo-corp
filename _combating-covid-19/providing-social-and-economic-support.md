Many different issues and concerns arose as a result of the pandemic. Due to the economic crisis, jobs were lost or salaries reduced. Students had to settle for home-based learning.

As such, platforms were quickly set up to assist with the various changes – such as websites to apply for COVID-19 grants.

# COVID-19 GoBusiness portal

The [GoBusiness platform](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/) for business was used as a one-stop portal to provide businesses with information on safe management requirements and to apply to resume operations.

# COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) application portal

Launched in May 2020 to provide temporary support to Singaporeans whose jobs have been affected by COVID-19. The CSG was available until the end of 2020 and approved 98,000 applications since its launch.

CSG was replaced with the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) with revised eligibility criteria in 2021

# COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) application portal

Launched in January 2021, [CRG](https://msf-csg.gov.sg/preinstruction/crg) is to continue the support to workers who need some temporary financial help. The Grant focuses on workers in lower- to middle-income households who are presently experiencing involuntary job loss and will be open for application until 31 December 2021.

# SupportGoWhere 

[SupportGoWhere](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/), a LifeSG initiative, provides citizens with a single portal to determine which assistance schemes they would be eligible for. It also has an Eligibility Checker, which lists the schemes that might be available to you when you answer a few questions.

# Student Learning Space

When schools had to be closed during the circuit breaker period, MOE tapped on the Student Learning Space (SLS) to ensure that learning could continue while the world battled COVID-19. With the help of SLS, 420,000 students and 33,000 teachers transitioned smoothly to home-based learning.
