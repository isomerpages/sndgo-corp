With the rapidly changing situation at the start of the pandemic, there was a critical need to ensure that the members of the public receive verified information to ensure that citizens are well-informed. After the initial anxiety had calmed down, the need for verified information is crucial to provide the public assurances that information is accurate with multiple sources of information.

Below is the list of sources where people can get verified information at any time, day or night.

# COVID-19 Situation Report Dashboard

This [COVID-19 Situatuional Report Dashboard](https://covidsitrep.moh.gov.sg/) presents the key statistics and figures on the current pandemic situation in Singapore.

# FluGoWhere

This [FluGoWher website](https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/) allows the public to find a PHPC clinic closest to them should they need to see a doctor if they have any respiratory infections.

PHPC clinics are equipped to handle cases with respiratory infections and provide subsidised treatment, investigations and medications during outbreaks. They play an essential role during public health outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 

# Gov.sg WhatsApp 

This [Gov.sg WhatsApp platform](https://www.gov.sg/article/govsg-on-whatsapp) delivers daily updates and information on COVID-19 to over 1.2 million subscribers in their preferred language. From this source, the members of the public can be assured that they are receiving verified information.

This platform is also used for other key Government announcements – such as the Budget and National Day Rally announcements.

# Gov.sg Info Bot 

As of December 2020, this tireless [Gov.sg Info Bot](https://www.gov.sg/infobot) addressed over 865k COVID-19 related queries to help the public stay updated on credible COVID-19-related news and information.

# TokenGoWhere

As the TraceTogether Token collection was launched in batches, [TokenGoWhere website](https://token.gowhere.gov.sg/) allowed citizens to check when the Community Centres (CC) closest to them would begin distribution and operating hours. The public can also check the Token stock levels at each CC to ensure that they would make a wasted trip down.

# MaskGoWhere

When the outbreak hit Singapore's shores, there was a surge in demand for facemasks, and many stores ran out of stocks. On 30 January 2020, it was announced that each household would receive four surgical masks from specific distribution centres between 1 – 9 February 2020.

GovTech created the [MaskGoWhere website](https://mask.gowhere.gov.sg/) for citizens to find the nearest centre to collect their masks based on their postal code within 48 hours.
