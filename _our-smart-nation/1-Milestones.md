	<div class="tab-content"><p>A “government data incident” happens when there is a compromise of government data. This includes unauthorised access to, collection of, use of, disclosure of, copying of, modification to, or disposal of, the government data.
</p><p>Some examples of a government data incident are:<ul>
<li>The sending of data via email to unintended recipients</li>
<li>The unintentional disclosure of data on a website due to a system error, and</li>
<li>The unauthorised movement (including copying, transfer and retrieval) of data by a hacker.</li></ul></p>

	<div class="tab-content"><p>You should act responsibly and promptly report any suspected data incidents to safeguard data from unauthorised use or loss. Please be mindful to conduct yourself in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and do not make a false report.
</p><p>When making a report, please provide as many details as possible. For example, when and where the incident occurred; how you detected the incident; the steps you took after you detected the incident. These details would help us in our investigation, and allow us to swiftly respond to the data incident and take the necessary remedial steps.</p>

							<label class="tab-label" for="chck_Q15">Q15. Where can I report a cybersecurity incident?</label>
							<div class="tab-content"><p>A cybersecurity incident is different from a data security incident. Cybersecurity incidents refer to attacks on IT systems or websites that affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems or websites. Data security incidents, or government data incidents, refer to the unauthorised access to, collection of, use of, disclosure of, copying of, modification to, or disposal of, government data.
<br><br>You may report a cybersecurity incident under the Government Technology Agency’s Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP). VDP encourages responsible reporting of suspected vulnerabilities or weaknesses in IT services, systems, resources and/or processes that may affect Government internet-accessible applications. Please click on this link to find out more about the VDP and report suspected vulnerabilities.</p>
