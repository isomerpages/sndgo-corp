_Singapore, 23 December 2020_
 
As at 21 December 2020, the percentage of Singapore residents participating in the TraceTogether (TT) Programme has surpassed the 70% mark, with more than 3.8 million people using the TT App or Token. More than 2.05 million unique users have downloaded and registered for the App, and more than 1.75 million Tokens have been collected to date. We are greatly encouraged by Singaporeans’ trust and participation in the national contact tracing efforts. The higher the adoption rate, the better we can facilitate effective contact tracing and the isolation of close contacts.

## CCs will re-open for TT Token collection progressively

2 TT Token collection at Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) was rolled out progressively from 14 September. The last remaining 6 CCs (Katong CC, Mountbatten CC, Kampong Kembangan CC, Kampong Ubi CC, Joo Chiat CC, Marine Parade CC) opened for collection today. Between 14th September and 23rd December, all CCs would have had a chance to open for Token distribution.

3 Since the distribution exercise began, we’ve observed a much higher-than-expected demand for Tokens, with collection at some CCs exceeding 50% of the constituency population. We understand that there are still many Singaporeans who want to collect a TT Token, and we will continue to build up stock to ensure that everyone who wants a Token will be able to get one. By end February 2021, we expect to have produced 5 million Tokens.

4 As stock becomes available, we will progressively re-open the distribution points in CCs that are currently closed, beginning from January 2021. The public will be informed of the opening dates at the CCs at least 3 days in advance. Residents can check the TokenGoWhere website (<a href="www.Token.gowhere.gov.sg" target="_blank">www.Token.gowhere.gov.sg</a>) or the community notice boards for the latest updates before heading down to the collection points.

## TraceTogether-only SafeEntry will be implemented after everyone has had a chance to collect their Token

5 TT-only SafeEntry will only be implemented after everyone has had a chance to collect a Token in their constituencies, and a reasonable period of national distribution is achieved.
Likewise, students do not need to have their Tokens when school reopens on 4 January 2021. We will distribute Tokens directly to the students in schools to make sure everyone has one, before we implement TT-only SafeEntry in schools. There is therefore no need to rush for collection at the CCs. More details will be shared at a later date.

6 We wish to remind Singaporeans that the TT App serves the same function as the TT Token, and there is no need to collect a Token if one has already registered with the App. In the meantime, the public can continue to perform SafeEntry check-ins by i) scanning on-site QR codes with a phone camera, ii) using SingPass Mobile and iii) scanning the barcodes in their personal ID.
