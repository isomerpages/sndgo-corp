In order to resume larger-scale activities and further reopen our economy in a safer manner, _TT-only SE_ will be progressively expanded to more venues. The use of _TT-only SE_ will provide added assurance that everyone present at these larger-scale activities is better protected by effective contact tracing through participation in the TT Programme.

2 _TT-only SE_ ensures that if a COVID-19 case is identified, we can quickly inform close contacts in those locations through the TT Programme. The close contacts can immediately take the necessary precautions to keep their loved ones safe.

3 By end of this year, we plan for all popular venues that currently require SE to transit to _TT-only SE_. The current modalities of i) scanning on-site QR codes with a phone camera, ii) using SingPass Mobile for SE check-in, and iii) scanning of personal IDs, will be disabled at venues where _TT-only SE_ is implemented. Instead, SE is allowed only if one uses their TT App to scan the on-site QR code, or if they let the on-site entry staff scan the QR code on their TT Token.

## Staged Rollout of TT-only-SE

4 Since August 2020, _TT-only SE_ has been trialled at selected venues where people are likely to be in close contact for prolonged periods, or where human traffic is high, to ensure that individuals at these venues are covered by the TT Programme.

5 From now till mid-November, _TT-only SE_ will be implemented in venues with activities that involve larger groups of people. These include live performances, business events, places of worship conducting congregational and other worship services with more than 100 people and cinemas. Members of the public who intend to attend these activities are encouraged to download the TT App or collect their TT Token as soon as possible.

6 By December, TT Tokens would already have been widely available for a substantial period of time. _TT-only SE_ will be implemented at all popular venues where SE is currently mandatory. This would include workplaces, schools, shopping malls and F&B outlets. The list of venues where SE is mandated today can be found in Annex A. The latest list of venues which will transit to TT-only SE will be updated on an ongoing basis at <a href="www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment" target="_blank">www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment</a>.

## TraceTogether Programme Crucial for Effective Contact Tracing

7 TT and SE are critical digital tools that allow us to quickly contain the spread of COVID-19 the moment it is detected, so that we can safely ease our measures and continue to resume economic and social activities. These tools help to stem multiple generations of spread and prevent large clusters from forming. We seek everyone’s cooperation in using SE and participating in the TT Programme, to make Singapore safer from COVID-19.

8 For those who cannot or prefer not to download the TT App, TT Tokens are now available for collection at 38 Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) around Singapore. By end November, TT Tokens will be made available at all 108 CCs islandwide.
