## Discontinuation of TraceTogether and SafeEntry

**5 February 2024**

* TraceTogether and SafeEntry systems no longer in use

* All COVID-19 related personal contact tracing data derived from TraceTogether and SafeEntry deleted as of 1 February 2024, with the exception of the TraceTogether data pertaining to a murder case in May 2020

The digital contact tracing systems, TraceTogether (TT) and SafeEntry (SE), will no longer be required as Singapore transitions towards managing COVID-19 like other endemic diseases.

### Part 11 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act

Part 11 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act was introduced by the Government and enacted by Parliament in February 2021. The purpose of doing so was to assure the public that personal contract tracing data collected by digital contact tracing systems under the Act would only be used for the purposes of contact tracing, or for criminal investigations and proceedings in respect of serious offences. One of the key safeguards was section 82(8), which provides for the Minister to&nbsp;specify a date after which the digital contact tracing systems are no longer required to prevent or control the spread of COVID-19. After that date, the data administrator of the digital contact tracing systems must stop all data collection and ensure the deletion of any personal contact tracing data used for the purpose of contact tracing from the systems.

Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, as the Minister charged with the responsibility for digital Government and public sector data governance, in consultation with Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, determined that these digital contact tracing systems would no longer be required after 5 January 2024 to prevent or control the spread of COVID-19. This is because the risk of a severe COVID-19 outbreak requiring TT and SE to be restarted in the immediate term is low.

### Deletion of TT and SE data

As of 1 February 2024, all COVID-19 related personal contact tracing data derived from TT and SE has been deleted except the TT data pertaining to a murder case in May 2020 which will be retained by&nbsp;the Singapore Police Force (SPF)&nbsp;indefinitely.&nbsp;This is necessary because legal applications may be made to challenge the conviction or sentence many years after the case has concluded. If so, the SPF may be obliged to disclose the data.

Registration details previously kept to enable quick set-up and registration for TT and SE in the event of a new Variant of Concern, have also been deleted.

### Discontinuation of TT and SE systems

Both the TT and SE (Business) App have been removed from the official mobile app stores, and the backend digital infrastructure supporting the TT and SE systems have been dismantled. The TT and SE websites have also been shut down.

Members of the public may uninstall their TT App, and enterprises may do the same for the SE (Business) App. Users can recycle their TT Tokens at any 3-in-1 e-waste bin located across the island.

TT and SE have served us well during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic by accelerating our contact tracing efforts and enabling the implementation of community safe management measures. We thank members of the public for their support of the TT programme and our digital contact tracing efforts in our fight against COVID-19.
