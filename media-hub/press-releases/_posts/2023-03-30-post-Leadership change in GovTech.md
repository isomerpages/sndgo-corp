## Leadership change in GovTech

**30 Mar 2023**

Mr Goh Wei Boon, Chief Executive at Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT), will be appointed as Chief Executive (CE) of the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) with effect from 1 June 2023. He succeeds Mr Kok Ping Soon, who will be appointed as CEO, Singapore Business Federation, on the same day.

As Chief Executive, CSIT, Mr Goh is responsible for applying and developing advanced digital technologies in support of security needs. In his 27 years in the Public Service, Mr Goh has held key technology development and leadership roles. Under his leadership, CSIT has grown to be a key national agency developing critical digital capabilities to serve cyber defence, counter-terrorism and other critical needs.

Mr Kok was appointed CE, GovTech on 1 May 2018. He spearheaded the implementation of the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB). Over the last five years, citizens and businesses satisfaction with government digital services have improved. He oversaw the development of the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS), the Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) and Government Cyber Security Operations Centre (GCSOC). He also set up the Digital Academy to raise digital capabilities in the public sector, and introduced a competency framework to recruit and develop officers in GovTech. During COVID-19, Ping Soon led the development of digital solutions such as TraceTogether and SafeEntry to support contact tracing. Under his leadership, GovTech has become a key engineering organisation to support the building of a Smart Nation.

“The Board of GovTech would like to thank Ping Soon for his steady and capable leadership of GovTech in a critical time of change and growth. He moulded GovTech into an organisation with people centricity and service at its core, delivering impact with an intentional focus on human capital, culture and organisation development. Under Ping Soon’s leadership, GovTech not only furthered the Digital Government mandate, but also played a critical part in our digital response during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mr Joseph Leong, Permanent Secretary (Smart Nation and Digital Government) and Chairman of GovTech.

“GovTech welcomes Wei Boon, who will build on the good work by Ping Soon. Wei Boon is deeply passionate about technology and its impact for public good. I expect he will continue to strengthen GovTech as an organisation and the digital capabilities that GovTech enables across government, to enable us in the next bound of Digital Government and Smart Nation,” added Mr Leong.
