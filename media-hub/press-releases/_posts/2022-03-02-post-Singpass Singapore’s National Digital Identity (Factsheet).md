<h2>Factsheet – Singpass (Singapore’s National Digital Identity)</h2>
<p><strong>2 Mar 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>Singpass, Singapore’s national digital identity, is one of the Smart Nation
strategic national projects. As a foundational digital infrastructure,
the national digital identity is critical to achieving our vision of improving
the lives of citizens, creating opportunities for businesses, and transforming
the capabilities of government agencies.</p>
<p>Singpass provides a convenient and secure platform for users to transact
with Government agencies and private sector organisations. To date, this
includes 700 organisations offering more than 2,000 services. Today, Singpass
has a user base of more than 4.5 million users, covering 97% of Singapore
Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 15 and above. More than 350 million
personal and corporate transactions are facilitated via Singpass every
year. The current suite of services includes the Singpass app, Myinfo,
Verify, Face Verification, Login and Myinfo business.</p>
<p>Ensuring inclusion and widespread access by all residents is a key remit
of Singpass. Features such as Face Verification and Multi-User SMS 2FA
ensure that even users without mobile phones can use Singpass to access
digital services. Face Verification can be used by any Singpass user who
has access to an internet-device with a web camera or front-facing camera,
including at public kiosks. The Multi-User SMS 2FA is an extension of the
existing SMS-OTP 2FA method. Users – who may require the assistance of
others when transacting online – can opt to have their SMS-OTP sent to
a trusted Singpass user’s mobile number, for example, of an immediate family
member.</p>
<p>Companies interested in using the Singpass’ suite of services can visit
the Singpass API Developer and Partner Portal at <a href="https://api.singpass.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.singpass.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<h3>Singpass app</h3>
<p>The Singpass app, a mobile user interface, provides users with convenient
and secure access to government and private sector services, online and
in-person. Some popular features include login shortcuts to common and
last-used digital services and a customisable profile to view personal
information at a glance. With the Singpass app, users can check their CPF
balance, apply for HDB flats, perform internet banking or manage their
insurance policies with ease while on the go; all without having to remember
passwords.</p>
<p>As of February 2022, there are more than 3.5 million Singpass app users.
About 85% of all Singpass transactions are conducted through the app, with
the remaining 15% using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) methods like Singpass
Face Verification. Users can set up their Singpass app easily with a face
scan using Singpass Face Verification.</p>
<h4>Digital IC</h4>
<p>Besides facilitating digital transactions, the Singpass app features the
user’s Digital Identity Card (Digital IC) on the homepage. Users can present
their Digital IC at government service counters for identity verification
or scan the Digital IC barcode at kiosks, such as in public libraries or
polyclinics. There are some exceptions where physical identification cards
are required by law, such as for marriage registrations and hotel check-ins.
The complete list of services that currently require the physical IC can
be found on the <a href="https://ask.gov.sg/singpass" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singpass FAQ site</a>.</p>
<p>The Digital IC has an animated and holographic lion crest at the corner
of the user’s photograph to deter image tampering and screenshot spoofing.
For privacy, the NRIC number or FIN is masked by default; user authentication
is required to view the full personal details on the Digital IC.</p>
<p>The Digital IC feature is not meant for downloading, printing or storing
of data. If personal data needs to be collected, agencies or businesses
are encouraged to use Verify or Myinfo to retrieve the data with the user’s
consent. Alternatively, agencies or businesses may manually record the
information displayed on the Digital IC into their systems. The collection
and use of data are subject to the Public Sector (Governance) Act or Personal
Data Protection Act where applicable.</p>
<h4>Document Wallet</h4>
<p>With their Singpass app, users can also access government-issued documents
in their Document Wallet under “My Profile”. For a start, users who intend
to travel can view their Vaccination HealthCerts in their Document Wallet
after obtaining them from the Notαrise portal. More document types will
be added in future.</p>
<h4>Inbox</h4>
<p>Users can receive relevant and timely notifications from government agencies
directly in their Singpass app inbox.</p>
<p>Current examples include (i) transactional notifications such as MediSave
deduction and payment reminders, (ii) pre-departure test certificate and
vaccination certificate notifications, and (iii) ICA passport renewal and
NRIC re-registration.</p>
<p>By accessing notifications through the Singpass app inbox, users can be
assured that the messages are authentic and sent by government agencies,
hence mitigating the risks of phishing emails or text messages.</p>
<h3>Other Singpass Suite of Services</h3>
<h4>Myinfo</h4>
<p>Myinfo enables users to pre-fill digital forms with their personal data
from government sources for online transactions, while giving them control
over how their information is shared.</p>
<p>To date, more than 800 digital services offered by government agencies
and businesses have been onboarded to Myinfo. The use of Myinfo has resulted
in an average decrease of up to 80% in application time for users, with
businesses reporting up to 15% higher approval rate due to better data
quality and significant cost savings in their customer acquisition process.
This service sees about 200,000 transactions a day.</p>
<h4>Verify</h4>
<p>Verify enables users to perform face-to-face identity verification and
secure transfer of personal information through scanning of QR codes or
tapping Near-Field Communication (NFC) devices. Using the Singpass app,
users simply scan a QR code (e.g., at an event registration counter) and
consent to have their basic personal details used in the transaction.</p>
<p>Verify allows contactless transactions without the need for individuals
to present or hand over their identity documents. This feature is currently
used for new patient registration at polyclinics, expressions of interest
at real estate show flats, and user verification for personal loan applications
and other form-filling transactions in the service sectors. Businesses
that require face-to-face registration processes, such as training providers,
may also integrate Verify into their workflow.</p>
<h4>Face Verification</h4>
<p>Face Verification is an authentication method that enables users to access
digital services on desktop or mobile browsers using a face scan. This
is then compared against the government’s biometric database (such as their
latest NRIC / Passport / Work Pass photo). Face Verification can be layered
upon businesses’ existing authentication process to enable multi-factor
authentication and provide a higher identity assurance, especially for
transactions involving sensitive information or high transaction values.</p>
<p>The feature also improves digital inclusion, as it can be used by individuals
who do not have mobile phones. This is being piloted for logins to government
digital services at kiosks located at various agencies such as IRAS Taxpayer
and Business Service Centre, Central Provident Fund Board, and Our Tampines
Hub’s Public Service Centre since April 2020. Over 87,000 sessions to access
services at these kiosks have been verified through the Face Verification
feature. More locations will be progressively added.</p>
<p>Face Verification has also helped significantly reduce the waiting time
for users visiting the service centres to reset their Singpass passwords
– a process that used to take an average of 10 minutes to complete with
physical documentations to verify their identity is now done within seconds.
The technology is easy to use and simplifies the process of user verification,
providing greater convenience to the users.</p>
<h4>Sign</h4>
<p>Sign enables users to digitally sign documents using their Singpass app.
Signing with Singpass provides convenience and increases productivity and
business efficiency – citizens no longer need to be physically present
to sign documents and agreements.</p>
<p>The user flow is similar to Singpass login – users simply scan the QR
code displayed on the screen and follow the on-screen instructions to complete
the authentication and signing process. Sign with Singpass produces a digital
signature that is cryptographically linked to the signer, which provides
higher assurance of the authenticity and integrity of the signed documents.
The digital signature can also be validated independently by other parties,
enabling end-to-end digitalisation even for workflows that involve multiple
organisations.</p>
<p>Businesses can either integrate their document workflows directly with
Sign API or use commercial document management products that are pre-integrated
with Sign API. To date, there are ten digital signing application providers
(CrimsonLogic, Dedoco, DocuSign, iText, Kofax, Modus, Netrust, Onespan,
RealEstateDoc and Tessaract.io) that have been pre-integrated with Sign
API. AIA Singapore, ERA Realty Network, Maybank, Prudential and UOB have
begun piloting Sign for their business applications. More than 140,000
signatures have been made using Singpass Sign in these transactions.</p>
<h3>For Businesses</h3>
<h4>Corporate Profile on the Singpass app</h4>
<p>From end March 2022, individuals with valid Corppass accounts will be
able to view their business entity information on the Singpass app. This
includes business owners and authorised employees of over 550,000 businesses
and entities (such as non-profit organisations and associations), who can
conveniently look up company details such as business registration and
shareholder information, as well as information on awarded government contracts
from the Singpass app, without the need to seek and access various sources
for the data. This is part of the Government’s commitment to offer citizens
and businesses convenient and secure access to data.</p>
<p>Similar to the “My Profile” section in the Singpass app for individuals
to view their personal data, business users will be able to easily access
pertinent corporate data in the new “My Corporate Profile” section. The
corporate profile is integrated with Myinfo business. This is useful in
instances when quick retrieval of the most up-to-date information is necessary,
like when applying for corporate banking and financial products.</p>
<p>GovTech will progressively announce and roll out more corporate features
on the Singpass app to improve and facilitate secure and seamless corporate
transactions.</p>
<h4>Login</h4>
<p>Businesses can tap on Login for authentication processes, while customers
can do away with remembering one additional set of credentials. To date,
there are more than 150 private sector digital services leveraging Login
as an authentication gateway, including OCBC Bank, Prudential, Singtel,
NTUC Union, Income Insurance, QBE Insurance, Singapore Exchange, the Employment
and Employability Institute (e2i), the Singapore Employers’ Federation
and JustLogin’s HR software.</p>
<h4>Myinfo business</h4>
<p>Similar to Myinfo, Myinfo business enables businesses to pre-fill digital
forms with entity data from government sources, such as corporate profile,
financial performance and ownership information. It facilitates more than
130 Government-to-Business (G2B) digital services such as applying for
a grant on the Business Grants Portal and invoicing agencies on Vendors@Gov.</p>
<p>This service has also been extended to private sector services, such as
the opening of corporate utility accounts and applying for SME loans. To
date, more than 80 private sector digital services have onboarded to Myinfo
business.</p>
