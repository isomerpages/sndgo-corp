The Minister for Health, Mr Gan Kim Yong, today revealed the strategic Health IT Master Plan (HITMAP) that has been guiding the healthcare sector’s IT programmes since 2014. With seven transformation programmes, the strategic HITMAP enables the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) three key shifts of moving beyond quality to value, beyond hospital to community, and beyond healthcare to health. It also supports policy formulation and evaluation, systems governance, public health and operations management, as well as strengthens IT resiliency and improves cost effectiveness. New projects such as the admissions prevention predictive model for the Ministry’s Hospital to Home Programme, Health Marketplace, and Vital Signs Monitoring were also unveiled in Minister Gan’s speech at the 9th National Health IT Summit 2017 held at Singapore Expo.

The seven transformation programmes are:  
* **Population Profiling:** develop common data analytic capabilities to link data across our healthcare and other non-healthcare data sources to provide actionable insights about our population  
* **Population Enablement**: develop a common platform for providers to engage patient/ caregiver/ consumer to deliver relevant information to them, collect new information from them and a common channel for them to interact with healthcare providers.  
* **Prevention and Continuity of Care:** develop a set of common capabilities to allow Regional Health Systems to execute primary, secondary and tertiary prevention programme and integrate various providers IT system in different settings to provide continuity of care to our patients.  
* **Provider Care & Operations Excellence:** enable the primary and intermediate & long term care sector with basic IT for them to connect with our Public Health Institutions (PHI) to share information about our patient; rationalise our PHI IT system towards our target architecture to optimise our IT effectiveness.  
* **Healthcare Financial Excellence:** ensure patient healthcare affordability and improve visibility in costs and outcomes so as to drive better cost effectiveness in our sector  
* **Policy & Public Health Workbench:** identify common information needs and develop common capabilities to collect, analyse those data to support policy formulation and public health management.  
* **IT Foundation & Resiliency:** develop common foundational IT capabilities to improve its scalability and resiliency

Mr Bruce Liang, Chief Executive Officer of IHiS and Chief Information Officer at MOH, said: “In the last decade, the primary role of Health IT was to support patient administrations and treatments in a healthcare setting. Over the next decade, Health IT will broaden to play a crucial role in treatment, preventive care and disease management outside the healthcare setting. To ensure we leverage technology in a strategic way, we developed the HITMAP. Since 2014, HITMAP has guided us in the use of technology to enhance service and accessibility and supports us in addressing the challenges of an increasing ageing population and chronic disease burden. However, we are in an age of rapid technological developments. To look beyond, we are planning an ‘upgrade’ of our Master Plan to incorporate more Smart Health programmes, a greater focus on value-based IT, expansive partnerships with ecosystem, computational capability development and a strengthened clinical informatics capability.”

Some 600 leaders from public and private healthcare attended the Summit organised by IHiS to discuss and exchange ideas on IT strategies, innovation, challenges, and integration to enhance patient care and improve citizen health. The event featured local and international experts who presented on topics related to the theme “Transformation Through Digital Services and Data”.

At the Summit, Minister Gan also presented the annual National Health IT Excellence Awards 2017, which recognised the teams behind thirteen winning projects as well as three individuals who were awarded Champions for Health IT Excellence Awards.
