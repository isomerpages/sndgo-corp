From 1 October 2017, motorists will be able to download the Parking.sg app on Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The mobile app is a quick and convenient way to pay for parking at all the 1,100 public car parks that currently use paper coupons[^1]. For a start, the mobile app can only be used for cars. It will be extended to motorcycles and heavy vehicles by the end of the year.

2 In line with Singapore’s vision to build a Smart Nation, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Housing & Development Board (HDB) and Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) announced the development of the Parking.sg app in May 2017. At the 2017 National Day Rally, PM announced that Parking.sg will be available to the general public by October 2017. The benefits of the mobile app include:

* **Paying for parking digitally:** Motorists can use the mobile app instead of coupons. They simply have to key in their vehicle number, select the car park, indicate their parking duration and start parking.
*  **Calculating parking charges automatically**: The mobile app automatically calculates the charges that motorists have to pay based on 30-minute blocks. If motorists end their parking session earlier, they will receive a refund and will only be charged on a per minute basis.
*   **Extending parking session remotely**: The mobile app will prompt motorists when the parking session is about to expire so they can extend the duration of their parking session, if required, at their convenience.

3 Trials were conducted in two phases – from May to June and from July to September – to test the functionalities of the mobile app and its backend system to ensure their robustness to take a higher load of users. More than 15,000 public officers and selected members of the public signed up for the trials.

4 The agencies have since incorporated feedback gathered from the trials, and improved the mobile app for better user experience, such as adding the parking history and notification feature that alerts the user before the parking session expires.

5 We would like to remind motorists who are using Parking.sg to activate the app to begin their parking session once they have parked their vehicle, as enforcement checks by patrolling officers will continue to be conducted.

6 Motorists who wish to use parking coupons can still do so, as parking coupons remain in use.

7 Currently, the car park code is reflected on the main signboard at the entrance of public car parks, including prominent locations along kerbside car parks. As the car park code is a mandatory field to be filled before a motorist can start a parking session in Parking.sg. URA and HDB have installed additional signage to enhance the visibility of the car park code.

8 This mobile app is a demonstration of how digital technology can be applied in practical ways to make citizens’ lives more convenient in a Smart Nation. To be user-centric, we took in user feedback early in the product development cycle through various trials and enhanced the product with new features along the way. This agile and iterative way of developing government digital products will enhance the Government’s ability to develop, improve and deliver innovative digital public services to benefit our citizens.
