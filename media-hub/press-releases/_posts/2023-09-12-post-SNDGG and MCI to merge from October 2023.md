## Smart Nation and Digital Government Group and Ministry of Communications and Information to merge from October 2023

**Singapore, 12 September 2023**

The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) will merge with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI)’s digital development functions to form an enlarged Smart Nation group. This merged entity will be part of the Prime Minister’s Office and administered by MCI. The merger will better position the Government to advance the full range of the digital agenda. The announcement was shared with SNDGG and MCI staff on 12 September 2023.

Today, SNDGG oversees the Smart Nation strategy, digitalisation of government services, and the development and application of digital technologies and capabilities across Singapore. MCI has been leading the development of the digital economy, digital readiness and inclusion, regulation of digital infrastructure and data, online regulation, and digital and cyber security. This is in addition to MCI’s role of coordinating Whole-of-Government information policy and public communications efforts.

Given the cross-cutting nature of digital developments, SNDGG and MCI have already been working closely together to design and implement our national and government digital strategies. The merged entity strengthens our capabilities and better positions Singapore to respond effectively to new opportunities and challenges in digital developments.

Notwithstanding the merger, the status and structures of the statutory boards and agencies under MCI and SNDGG remain unchanged. There will be also no change to the political office holders. Mrs Josephine Teo will continue to serve as the Minister for Communications and Information, and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity. Dr Janil Puthucheary and Mr Tan Kiat How will remain as the Senior Ministers of State for Communications and Information, with Dr Janil Puthucheary continuing as Minister-in-charge of GovTech. Likewise, there is no change to appointments to the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), the National Library Board Singapore (NLB), and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).

The merger will be effected in phases, with MCI commencing the administration of the Smart Nation group from 23 October 2023. Other details will be worked out over the coming months and shared when ready.
