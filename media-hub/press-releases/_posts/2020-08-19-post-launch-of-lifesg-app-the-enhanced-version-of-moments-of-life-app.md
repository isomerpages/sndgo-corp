# MORE FEATURES, REFRESHED LOOK

Minister-in-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Dr Vivian Balakrishnan launched LifeSG, the enhanced version of the Moments of Life (MOL) mobile application today. The LifeSG app will provide users with access to more than 40 services that will be personalised for citizens, and with an improved user experience.

## Launch of LifeSG at Smart Nation Webinar

2\.  The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG), comprising the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and the Government Technology Agency, is rebranding MOL to LifeSG to reflect the app’s future direction – from serving citizens at specific milestones of life, to providing all citizens with a one-stop, personalised access to a wider range of government services. Dr Vivian Balakrishnan announced the key changes at the Smart Nation webinar titled, “Putting People First in Tech Design”. The webinar is part of SNDGO’s ongoing “Smart Nation –  _In Conversation”_ series to engage Singaporeans on Smart Nation initiatives. More details on the MOL initiative can be found in  **Annex A**.

## New Features and Refreshed Interface for LifeSG

3\. LifeSG will  offer users more ready access to digital government services through the consolidation of personalised content. The app will include a new user interface with improved navigation, topical guides and the following features. Please refer to  Annex B for screenshots of the revamped app.

   **a. Explore Services –**  Citizens can explore and easily access more than 40 Government services (up from 12 services previously featured on the app). Information displayed is grouped according to topics of interest, such as family and parenting, work and employment, healthcare, housing and property, and other frequently-used digital services. More services will be added progressively. The full list of services available on LifeSG can be found in  Annex C.

   **b. Personalised Dashboard**  – Citizens can use the dashboard to discover recommended content, access guides that simplify processes such as job & preschool searches and discover government benefits through features such as the Family Support Calculator.

4\. Upcoming plans will include an improved dashboard to provide citizens with an overview of key personal information such as their CPF, housing, and education details. The app will also include upcoming medical and school appointments, and reminders that prompt users to complete important applications such as birth registration, baby bonus and primary school registration.

5\. Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive, GovTech, said, “This product and brand refresh reflects our commitment to serve citizens beyond key moments of life. We started with features developed for parents with young children in 2018 and the Merdeka Generation in 2019. This year, we introduced timely features for those in need of employment and COVID-related support. We will continue to extend simpler access to digital services and personalised content to more citizens, and evaluate their needs and feedback to improve the app with more useful features.”
