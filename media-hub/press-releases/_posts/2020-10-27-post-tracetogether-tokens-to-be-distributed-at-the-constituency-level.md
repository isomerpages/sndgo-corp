title:  TraceTogether Tokens To Be Distributed At The Constituency Level

---

Starting 29 October, TraceTogether (TT) Tokens will be distributed at the constituency level to better match demand and to avoid long queues. New collection venues will be open one constituency at a time. Stock will be set aside for residents belonging to that constituency. Residents should only collect their Tokens from their designated collection venue, scheduled to start at specified dates. Residents in each constituency will be informed accordingly. 

2.	We had previously announced that residents could collect Tokens at any collection venue. Following the announcement that either a TT App or TT Token will be needed to perform SafeEntry check-in (TT-only-SE) across a range of popular venues, demand has surged at existing collection points, leading to long queues at some Community Centres/Clubs (CC). 

3.	We will therefore temporarily suspend distribution at the 38 CCs where TT Token distribution has been ongoing for the past six weeks in order to shift to a new mode of distribution, one constituency at a time. 

4.	The new mode of distribution will begin on 29 October, starting initially with Marsiling CC, and for residents in that constituency only. More constituency CCs will be progressively opened for the collection of Tokens from October to December. By the second half of December, all CCs will be opened for collection, including the initial 38 CCs. Residents in these 38 CCs who have not yet collected their Tokens during the first collection wave, will be able to do so at that time. 

5.	Residents can check the TokenGoWhere website (<a href="Token.gowhere.gov.sg" target="_blank">Token.gowhere.gov.sg</a>) to find their designated collection venue, as well as the full collection schedule. Please refer to [Annex A (pdf - 1.8mb)](/files/press-releases/2020/sndgg-tt-token-distribution-oct-2020-annex-a.pdf) for the full list of collection venues and distribution dates.

6. Members of the public may use either the TT App or the TT Token for TT-only-SE check-in. Both serve the same function of recording close contact data, supplemented by SE data for comprehensive digital contact tracing – critical for safe reopening as we move towards Phase 3. 

7.	There is therefore no need to collect the TT Token if you are already using the TT App, or are able to download the TT App on your smart phone.
