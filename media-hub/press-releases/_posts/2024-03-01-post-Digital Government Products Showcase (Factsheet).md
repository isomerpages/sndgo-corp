## Factsheet - Digital Government Products Showcase


Themed **“Tech for Public Good”**, the Digital Government Products Showcase features digital products developed by GovTech and prototypes by Open Government Products (OGP). The showcase features the latest digital government products that Members of Parliament can share with their constituents. The prototypes on display embody the culture of experimentation that GovTech and OGP embrace in our pursuit to create products that serve the public good.

Held at the Parliament House from 29 February to 1 March 2024, the showcase consists of four zones:

**<u>Zone 1: Tech for Public Good Delivering Positive Impact</u>** 
<br> _The digital government products in this zone aim to improve the day-to-day lives of Singaporeans._

It seeks to boost vaccination and cancer screening rates by making it easy to book appointments at nearby CHAS GP clinics and creating a society free of major preventative illnesses.
| 2 | **GatherSG**<br>Lead agency: GovTech |     The <b>GatherSG </b>Tech Stack is the digital backbone of a case management system that can be customised to agencies’ specific needs to support various use cases, enabling cost savings due to shared infrastructure. It enables social service officers to better manage cross-agency cases and improve Whole-of-Government (WOG) service delivery. It also features an Assisted Living function which provides aid to seniors living alone. |
| 3    | **Kaki OneService Chatbot** <br> Lead agencie: GovTech, Municipal Services Office (MSO)  |     **Kaki OneService Chatbot** is a tool powered by machine learning to enable citizens to provide feedback about day-to-day issues such as malfunctioning corridor lights, leaky covered walkways, and littered common areas. <br><br> The chatbot can identify the nature of the municipal issues raised, classify it into the appropriate category, extract relevant details of the incident that needs attention, and identify and contact the correct government agency to act on the case. This makes it easier for residents to interact with the government.

**<u>Zone 2: Trust and Inclusivity</u>** <br>_Building a digital government starts with understanding what our citizens need and ensuring that no one is left behind. The products in this zone aim to build trust and ensure inclusivity for our citizens._
