1\.  Expect a more energy-efficient lighting system on our roads by 2022, as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) steps up efforts to harness technology for a more sustainable land transport system.  

2\.  LTA has started implementing energy-efficient Light Emitting Diodes (LED) for our street lights since 2013, and will extend this technology to all street lights island-wide. LTA will also replace the existing timer-based street lighting system with a Remote Control and Monitoring System (RCMS) to allow the system to be more responsive to weather changes.

## LED Street Lights to Cut Energy Consumption by 25%

3\.  Based on findings from trials[^1] which LTA conducted for medium-powered and high-powered LED lightings, LED street lights are about 25 per cent more energy-efficient than current street lighting. In addition, LED lighting is more reliable and requires less frequent replacement. This helps conserve energy and reduce maintenance and manpower costs[^2].
     
4\.  Since 2014, LTA has installed LED lighting for approximately 4,000 street lights. LTA will be calling tenders to replace all 25,000 street lights in the Central area with LED street lights by 2019. Street lights in all other areas will be replaced with LED lighting by 2022.  

5\.  Please refer to the [Annex (170kb)](/files/press-releases/2017/20170103-LEDLightingTrialLocs.pdf) for photographs of LED lighting at the trial locations, and the implementation timeline for LED lighting across Singapore.

## New Remote Control and Monitoring System

6\.  LTA will also develop a Remote Control and Monitoring System (RCMS) to allow street lighting to be more responsive to inclement weather. Currently, street lights operate at pre-programmed seasonal sunrise and sunset timings. With the RCMS, LTA can remotely switch street lights on and off in response to varying street lighting needs. The RCMS will also enable LTA to have a more responsive and efficient maintenance regime as it features automated fault detection and alert capabilities.

## More integrated efforts in building a Smart Nation

7\.  Besides the RCMS, the Government Technology Agency will leverage LTAâ€™s smart lighting infrastructure to test the feasibility of deploying a shared network for low bandwidth wireless sensors. As part of our Smart Nation initiative, interconnected lampposts are envisioned to be a key part of our national sensor communications network. Besides tapping on the existing public lighting infrastructure, this trial will involve the private sector working with the government and enable smart, connected sensors and objects to deliver more efficient and smarter services to benefit citizens.

[^1]: Trials for medium-powered LED lightings were conducted at Northumberland Road and Tekka Lane from 2010 to 2013. Trials for high-powered LED lightings were conducted at Lor 1 Toa Payoh and West Coast Highway from 2013 to 2016.

[^2]: LED lightings require less maintenance compared to the current High Pressure Sodium Vapour (HPSV) lightings as the components can last an average of 10 years compared to HPSV lamps, which require replacement every three years in order to achieve the required lighting output.
