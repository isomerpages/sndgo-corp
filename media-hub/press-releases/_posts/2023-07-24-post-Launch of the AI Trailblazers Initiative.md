--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**24 July 2023**

*   _Singapore’s first Generative AI Innovation Sandboxes established to accelerate the development of generative AI solutions that address organisations' real-world challenges_
*   _Innovation Sandboxes and tailored hands-on workshops aimed at identifying and addressing 100 generative AI use cases across government and industry within the next 100 days_ 
*   _Initiative is part of MCI, DISG, and Google Cloud’s strategic collaboration to bolster Singapore’s National AI Strategy, with further initiatives to be unveiled in the coming months_

The [ Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI)](https://www.mci.gov.sg), [ Digital Industry Singapore (DISG)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/disg), [Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO)](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/about-smart-nation/sndgg), and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) today announced the launch of “AI Trailblazers,” a joint initiative designed to help organisations in Singapore identify real-world challenges that can be addressed with [generative AI](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/generative-ai), build generative AI solution prototypes, and bring these prototypes to production.

Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Mrs Josephine Teo was the Guest-of-Honour at the launch event for this initiative, which was hosted at the Google Asia Pacific campus. At the event, Minister Teo delivered opening remarks, viewed demos of generative AI solutions developed by startup and public sector teams, and interacted with the first cohort of AI Trailblazers workshop participants.

This announcement builds on the [strategic collaboration between MCI and Google Cloud](https://www.mci.gov.sg/pressroom/news-and-stories/pressroom/2023/5/developing-singapore-into-an-open-and-trusted-global-ai-hub) and the launch of the AI Government Cloud Cluster (AGCC) by SNDGO and Google Cloud in May 2023. It aims to advance Singapore’s position as an open and trusted global AI hub by accelerating the development and adoption of responsible and impactful AI solutions to maximise opportunities arising from Singapore and the region.
