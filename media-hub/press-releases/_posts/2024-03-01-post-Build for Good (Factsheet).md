<h2>Factsheet - Build for Good</h2>
<p>Build for Good is a month-long hackathon organised by Open Government
Products, for citizens to build solutions that tackle various problems
in Singapore. The initiative empowers citizens to contribute and lead the
change to help make Singapore better.</p>
<p>Build for Good was conceptualised for tech-savvy volunteers to come forward
to build digital solutions for their fellow citizens to build a better
Singapore. Participating teams will identify challenges throughout the
event, build prototypes, and extensively test their ideas with real users.
The goal of Open Government Products is to provide citizens who are eager
to make Singapore better with the support and resources they need to turn
their ideas into reality. Going beyond co-creation, citizens take the lead
to identify problems and build solutions for a better Singapore.</p>
<p>After choosing a problem statement to work on, participating teams will
identify solutions, build prototypes, and test them with users. They will
be provided the necessary support through their journey, such as mentorship,
workshops and resources. At the finale, teams will present their solutions
to government leaders and industry experts, and winning teams will receive
sponsorship for further product development.</p>
<p>The event provides an end-to-end citizen empowerment process by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Giving citizens a voice to identify problems faced in Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitating citizens’ access to the Government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping citizens to improve on existing skills and gain new insights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentoring citizens to have the confidence and focus to build impactful
solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following its inaugural run in 2023, Build for Good has created 13 working
prototypes. These projects address citizens’ concerns ranging from environment
and sustainability, to healthcare and anti-scam solutions. One of these
projects, NoteFlow, aims to enhance school counsellors’ ability to provide
high-quality care to students. The team has completed its alpha testing
and they are currently running a pilot to test the efficacy of the solution.</p>
<p>Build for Good will continue with 2 rounds of hackathon in 2024:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Environment &amp; Sustainability Themed Hackathon in partnership between
OGP and MSE to be hosted in May 2024 - Environment &amp; Sustainability
(one of the top 3 problem domains identified by citizens in 2023)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General Hackathon hosted by OGP in Aug 2024</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each hackathon will be followed by an 8-week accelerator programme for
winning teams, so that working prototypes can be developed into minimum
viable products (MVPs). We also have started Build for Good community mixers
since Dec 2023 so that passionate citizens can be further inspired to take
action to build a better Singapore through project sharings, talks, workshops
and community pitches by members of the public.</p>
<h3>Noteflow</h3>
<p>Noteflow is an app for school counsellors that uses artificial intelligence
to transcribe and sort their case notes, thus saving them time.</p>
<p>School counsellors often have busy schedules, handling various responsibilities,
such as counselling sessions, meetings, and administrative tasks. Limited
time can make it challenging for them to dedicate sufficient attention
to documenting case notes which can affect case note documentation and
quality of care.</p>
<p>NoteFlow will help busy school counsellors write comprehensive case notes
quicker using a combination of real-time transcription, efficient note
synthesis, and responsive querying. With NoteFlow, counsellors can bid
farewell to lengthy note-taking sessions and say hello to comprehensive
case notes in a fraction of the time. Leveraging AI, our platform streamlines
the documentation process, allowing counsellors to focus more on what truly
matters— the wellness of their students.</p>
