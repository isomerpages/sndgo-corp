## Launch of Smart Nation PlayScape - Demystifying Technology Through Play 


**29 May 2023**

* <i>Permanent exhibition at Science Centre Singapore developed with ideas, feedback and contributions from more than 200 members of the community</i>
* <i>New ‘digital playground’ seeks to interest children and youths in emerging technology</i>

Want to learn about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning through games? Or “travel” to exotic places such as the Aurora Storms in Greenland or Coral Reefs in Philippines through Virtual Reality (VR) displays? You can do these and more at the Smart Nation PlayScape, co-created with ideas, feedback and contributions from more than 200 members of the community, including students, private companies and members of the public.

Smart Nation PlayScape, an exhibition jointly led by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) and Science Centre Singapore (SCS), aims to demystify technology and inspire young Singaporeans aged 10 and above, to be curious about future technologies. Smart Nation PlayScape also seeks to foster parent-child bonding and interest the wider community on the possibilities that technology has to offer. It was launched today by Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity, Mrs Josephine Teo.

#### Bringing technology to life through fun interactives and games

Smart Nation PlayScape consists of eight zones which showcase the underlying concepts behind technologies in a fun and relatable way. They include: Sensors, Geospatial, Biometrics and Cybersecurity, Blockchain, AI and Data Analytics, Robotics, User Experience (UX) and Services, and Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).

Guests will get to experience and understand these technologies through multi-player game interactives, for example – by answering a riddle collectively to learn about blockchain, or pitting their doodling skills against a friend’s to learn about AI predictive models. Through gamification, guests will also be able to better appreciate real-life applications of different technologies powering our Smart Nation. More details on the exhibits can be found in the <u>Annex</u>.

#### Community participation key in shaping visitor experience at Smart Nation PlayScape

Since 2022, SNDGG has been engaging various segments of the community, from students to working adults and retirees, to create a meaningful and enriching experience for guests. Feedback from about 150 members of the public were gathered by our Smart Nation Ambassadors at an early preview of Smart Nation PlayScape, while close to 40 Changkat Changi Secondary School students participated in a focus group discussion in April 2022, which provided deeper insights on the AR and VR zones, and Cabinet of Curiosities. The ideas and suggestions have improved the overall interactivity, accessibility, and wayfinding of the Smart Nation PlayScape, contributing to a more immersive experience for guests. Private companies such as health technology company Oura and Singapore-based toy company Mighty Jaxx also contributed items to showcase how technology has improved our daily lives, from smart rings that can track our sleep patterns and heart rate, to collectible figurines that come with blockchain-based digital certificates to prove their authenticity.

Earlier this year, some of the students from Changkat Changi Secondary School were invited back to participate in a user-testing session. The students were thrilled to witness how their ideas and suggestions came to life. In particular, the students appreciated the interactivity of the AR exhibit, where guests can grow a virtual plant on a tabletop garden scape and how the VR station enabled them to experience places they have never visited.

SNDGG is currently working together with Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) students to develop educational resources for primary school students, which will complement their learning experience at the Smart Nation PlayScape. From May to June this year, over 450 NP students will be conducting guided tours for children from student care centres. These firsthand interactions with the children will enable the NP students to develop interactive and engaging content that seeks to pique the interest of our young guests in emerging technology.

To extend the reach of Smart Nation PlayScape, SNDGG is also partnering with National Library Board to bring selected exhibit interactives closer to youths at libraries in various neighbourhoods. Known as Smart Nation PlayScape ‘Lite’, the roving exhibition at the libraries will help to raise awareness and generate excitement about emerging technologies among many Singaporeans, and drive interested youths to explore other library programmes.

Smart Nation PlayScape is a permanent exhibition at Science Centre Singapore, accessible with a general admission ticket. Tickets can be purchased through the online ticketing platform at <a href="https://www.gevme.com/scsonlinetickets">https://www.gevme.com/scsonlinetickets</a>.
