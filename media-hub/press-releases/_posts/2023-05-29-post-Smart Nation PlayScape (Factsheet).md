## Factsheet – Smart Nation PlayScape

**29 May 2023**

Smart Nation PlayScape aims to demystify technology and inspire young Singaporeans to be curious about future technologies through a series of fun and immersive exhibits. Guests can learn about the variety of digital technologies powering Smart Nation initiatives and discover the different possibilities that these technologies have to offer.

Smart Nation PlayScape consists of eight zones of exhibits:

	<div style="font-size:18px"><b>Exhibit 1A: Sensors I</b><br><br>This exhibit shows how different sensors can tell us important details about our bodies. <br><br>Guests can step into the booth and have their vitals (e.g. height, weight, breath rate) read using different sensors. They can even take a special thermal camera selfie that shows their body heat. <br>

	<div style="font-size:18px"><b>Exhibit 3A: Biometrics I</b><br><br>This exhibit shows how biometric data – such as our facial features and fingerprints – is processed with a high degree of accuracy and speed, to recognise us as individuals.<br><br> This multi-player game will challenge players to express an emotion, which the machine will rate using facial recognition technology. The player rated with the ‘best’ matching expression wins.<br>
</div>

	<div style="font-size:18px"><b>Exhibit 4: Blockchain</b><br><br>This exhibit demonstrates how blockchain works by creating a system based on mutually verified questions and answers. <br><br> In this interactive exhibit, guests answer a riddle individually. Only when all players enter the same answer (i.e. mutual agreement), there is consensus, and a ‘block’ is added to the chain.<br>
