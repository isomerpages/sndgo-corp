## Factsheet – Smart Nation PlayScape

**29 May 2023**

Smart Nation PlayScape aims to demystify technology and inspire young Singaporeans to be curious about future technologies through a series of fun and immersive exhibits. Guests can learn about the variety of digital technologies powering Smart Nation initiatives and discover the different possibilities that these technologies have to offer.

Smart Nation PlayScape consists of eight zones of exhibits:

	<div style="font-size:18px"><b>Exhibit 1A: Sensors I</b><br><br>This exhibit shows how different sensors can tell us important details about our bodies. <br><br>Guests can step into the booth and have their vitals (e.g. height, weight, breath rate) read using different sensors. They can even take a special thermal camera selfie that shows their body heat. <br>

| Exhibit | Featured Technology |   Description ||
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1a    | Sensors I | This exhibit shows how different sensors can tell us important details about our bodies. <br><br>Guests can step into the booth and have their vitals (e.g. height, weight, breath rate) read using different sensors. They can even take a special thermal camera selfie that shows their body heat. <br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Sensors I](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_1a_sensor%20i.png)<br>  | 	<br><br>
|1b | Sensors II | This exhibit showcases how sensor networks help collect and visualise different types of data, which guides operators to make better decisions. <br><br>Guests can learn how the network of sensors around Singapore provides important information such as weather, taxi, air and sea traffic in real-time.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Sensors II](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_1b_sensors%20ii.jpg)<br>| <br><br>
|2| Geospatial | This exhibit showcases how locational technology helps us to do better land planning and build well-designed and community-centric neighbourhoods. <br><br>Guests can play a game with the use of building blocks reflecting the different elements of a city (e.g. hospitals, parks, schools) to improve the quality of life in the city they are building.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Geospatial](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_2_geospatial.jpg)<br>| <br><br>
|3a | Biometrics I | This exhibit shows how biometric data – such as our facial features and fingerprints – is processed with a high degree of accuracy and speed, to recognise us as individuals.<br><br> This multi-player game will challenge players to express an emotion, which the machine will rate using facial recognition technology. The player rated with the ‘best’ matching expression wins.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Biometrics I](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_3a_biometrics.png)<br> | <br><br>
|3b| Biometrics II | This exhibit explains how one of the most common biometric authentication methods – fingerprint scanning, works! <br><br>Guests can analyse their fingerprint, identify their fingerprint pattern and find out how common or rare their patterns are in relation to others.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Biometrics II](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_3b_biometrics%20ii.jpg)<br> | <br><br>
|3c| Cybersecurity | This exhibit educates guests on the importance of staying cybersafe in a world full of growing cyber threats. <br><br>Guests will learn how to spot tell-tale signs of common scam tactics through an interactive quiz. <br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Cybersecurity](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_3c_cybersecurity.jpg)<br>| <br><br>
|4 | Blockchain | This exhibit demonstrates how blockchain works by creating a system based on mutually verified questions and answers. <br><br> In this interactive exhibit, guests answer a riddle individually. Only when all players enter the same answer (i.e. mutual agreement), there is consensus, and a ‘block’ is added to the chain.<br><br> | ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Blockchain](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_4_blockchain.png)<br> | |<br><br>
|5a | Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics (I) | This exhibit showcases how AI can be trained to serve us better - by inputting clean data for it to analyse, visualise and create predictive models. <br><br>In this multi-player game, players challenge each other to drawing simple objects that the AI machine is trained to identify.| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, AI, Data Analytics I](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_5a_ai%20data%20analytics%20i.jpg)<br>| <br><br>
|5b| Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics (II) | This exhibit shows how machine learning works by teaching a computer to identify patterns and to make decisions based on data. <br><br>Players can ‘train’ a computer to identify and differentiate various animal shapes (e.g. dog, cat, rabbit), by placing it in front of a camera, without writing any code.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, AI, Data Analytics II](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_5b_ai%20data%20analytics%20ii.jpg)<br>| <br><br>
|6a| Robotics I  |This exhibit highlights how robots can learn or do things as well as (or better than) humans. <br><br>Guests can scramble a Rubik’s Cube and place it in a machine to watch how quickly the robot solves it. <br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Robotics I](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_6a_robotics%20i.jpg)<br> | <br><br>
|6b| Robotics II | This exhibit showcases how robots can be programmed to do specific tasks repetitively and accurately.<br><br> Guests can programme a robot to dance by choosing a series of dance moves.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Robotics II](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_6b_robotics%20ii.jpg)<br>| <br><br>
|7| User Experience (UX) and Services | This exhibit helps guests to understand the basic principles of good UX design, and how to apply them to meet the needs of different users. <br><br>Guests can play a series of games to design an app using UX principles. They also get to experience issues encountered by some end-users, such as colour blindness and short-sightedness.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, UX and Services](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_7_ux%20and%20services.jpg)<br>| <br><br>
|8a| Augmented Reality (AR) &amp; Virtual Reality (VR) I | This exhibit shows guests the possibilities of VR, allowing guests to explore places that they might not have access to or perhaps have yet to visit. <br><br>In this interactive exhibit, users get to ‘travel the world’ by experiencing the unique sights of different places like Aurora Storms in Greenland, Mount Rigi in Switzerland, Coral Reefs in Philippines, and Pyramids in Egypt.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, AR, VR I](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_8a_ar%20vr%20i.png)<br> | <br><br>
|8b| Augmented Reality (AR) &amp; Virtual Reality (VR) II | This exhibit demonstrates how AR can help make learning more immersive, by overlaying digital content onto the real world.<br><br> In this interactive experience, guests can grow virtual plants on a tabletop garden scape and pick up basic gardening skills by selecting the best growing conditions for their plant.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, AR, VR II](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_8b_ar%20vr%20ii.png)<br>| <br><br>
|Central Display| Cabinet of Curiosities (Everyday tech) | The central display called ‘Cabinet of Curiosities’, features a collection of objects that showcase how technology is already shaping our lives – from how we stay healthy, to how we shop, travel and play. <br><br>Guests can explore an assortment of objects, categorised into four themes, with each object telling a story about a specific technology.<br><br>| ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Cabinet of Curiosities](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_coc.jpg)<br>| <br><br>
