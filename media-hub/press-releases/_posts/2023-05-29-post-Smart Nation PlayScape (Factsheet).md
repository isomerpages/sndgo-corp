Factsheet – Smart Nation PlayScape
-----------------------------------------------------

**29 May 2023**

Smart Nation PlayScape aims to demystify technology and inspire young Singaporeans to be curious about future technologies through a series of fun and immersive exhibits. Guests can learn about the variety of digital technologies powering Smart Nation initiatives and discover the different possibilities that these technologies have to offer.

Smart Nation PlayScape consists of eight zones of exhibits:



| Exhibit | Featured Technology | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1a    | Sensors I ![Smart Nation PlayScape, Sensors I](/images/media-hub/press-release/2023/playscape_1a_sensor%20i.png)  | This exhibit shows how different sensors can tell us important details about our bodies. <br><br>Guests can step into the booth and have their vitals (e.g. height, weight, breath rate) read using different sensors. They can even take a special thermal camera selfie that shows their body heat. |	<br><br>
|1b | Sensors II | This exhibit showcases how sensor networks help collect and visualise different types of data, which guides operators to make better decisions. <br><br>Guests can learn how the network of sensors around Singapore provides important information such as weather, taxi, air and sea traffic in real-time.|<br><br>
|2| Geospatial | This exhibit showcases how locational technology helps us to do better land planning and build well-designed and community-centric neighbourhoods. <br><br>Guests can play a game with the use of building blocks reflecting the different elements of a city (e.g. hospitals, parks, schools) to improve the quality of life in the city they are building.|
|3a | Biometrics I | This exhibit shows how biometric data – such as our facial features and fingerprints – is processed with a high degree of accuracy and speed, to recognise us as individuals.<br><br> This multi-player game will challenge players to express an emotion, which the machine will rate using facial recognition technology. The player rated with the ‘best’ matching expression wins.|<br><br>
|3b| Biometrics II | This exhibit explains how one of the most common biometric authentication methods – fingerprint scanning, works! <br><br>Guests can analyse their fingerprint, identify their fingerprint pattern and find out how common or rare their patterns are in relation to others.|
|3c| Cybersecurity| This exhibit educates guests on the importance of staying cybersafe in a world full of growing cyber threats. <br><br>Guests will learn how to spot tell-tale signs of common scam tactics through an interactive quiz. |
|4 | Blockchain | This exhibit demonstrates how blockchain works by creating a system based on mutually verified questions and answers. <br><br> In this interactive exhibit, guests answer a riddle individually. Only when all players enter the same answer (i.e. mutual agreement), there is consensus, and a ‘block’ is added to the chain. |
