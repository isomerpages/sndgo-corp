-----------------------------------------------------

**29 May 2023**

Smart Nation PlayScape aims to demystify technology and inspire young Singaporeans to be curious about future technologies through a series of fun and immersive exhibits. Guests can learn about the variety of digital technologies powering Smart Nation initiatives and discover the different possibilities that these technologies have to offer.

Smart Nation PlayScape consists of eight zones of exhibits:



| Exhibit | Featured Technology | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1a    | Sensors I     | This exhibit shows how different sensors can tell us important details about our bodies. Guests can step into the booth and have their vitals (e.g. height, weight, breath rate) read using different sensors. They can even take a special thermal camera selfie that shows their body heat. |
