## All Government Agencies To Accept Singpass Digital IC From 1 November 2021

**28 October 2021**

All Government agencies will accept, from 1 November 2021, the Digital Identity Card (IC) on the Singpass app as an alternative means to prove an individual’s identity for in-person agency services. This marks a significant milestone for Smart Nation, in which people can tap on this proof of identification to transact digitally with public and private sector entities.

Singpass, our trusted national digital identity, provides a convenient and secure platform for users to transact with the Government and other private sector service providers. Today, 97% of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 15 years old and above have Singpass accounts, making it one of the most pervasively adopted national digital identity systems in the world. There are over 3.2 million Singpass app users, and about 300 million personal and corporate Singpass transactions[^1] every year.

### All Government agencies to accept Digital IC, except for instances when physical document is required under the legislation

With the wider acceptance of Digital IC by the Government, Singpass app users can confidently and conveniently prove their identity using the Digital IC when transacting at Government counters, polyclinics and public libraries. This means that users will no longer need to bring their physical IC, except in a few instances[^2] , e.g., when the legislation requires a physical identity document such as for marriage registrations and hotel check-ins. We are working on amending the legislation to formalise the use of Digital IC for these exceptions.

### Enhancements to the Digital IC feature in Singpass app

The Digital IC feature was introduced in the Singpass app in May 2020. To enhance the user experience, we have improved the user interface in the Singpass app. The Digital IC feature is now displayed prominently on the homepage, making it easy for users to access. The public is encouraged to update their Singpass app to the latest version to enjoy the improved features. Screenshots of the new app interface can be found in **Annex A**.

As the Digital IC serves as an official identification document, security measures are in place to protect the user’s identity. The Digital IC features the user’s latest photograph provided to the Government and is accompanied by an animated and holographic lion crest to prevent image tampering and screenshot spoofing. In addition, users’ NRIC numbers or FIN are masked by default to protect their privacy during transactions, and user authentication is required to view the full details on the Digital IC.

Currently, the Digital IC is also accepted by service providers such as SingHealth Polyclinics and we hope to onboard more private sector companies to do so, to encourage the use of the Digital IC as a way of life in Smart Nation Singapore.
