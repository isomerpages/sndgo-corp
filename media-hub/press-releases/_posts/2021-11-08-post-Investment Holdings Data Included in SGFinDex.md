## Investment Holdings Data Included in SGFinDex 

**08 Nov 2021**

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Smart 
Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) today launched the second phase of the 
Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex). Individuals can now view information on their 
investment holdings at The Central Depository (CDP) as part of their consolidated financial 
position via participating banks’ financial planning applications and [MyMoneySense](https://www.mymoneysense.gov.sg/), a free 
government financial planning digital service. 

Since its inception on 7 December 2020, SGFinDex has spurred financial planning 
among participating bank customers with over 150,000 unique users sign ups, 290,000 bank 
accounts linked and 620,000 data retrievals made. CDP’s participation in SGFinDex expands 
the range of financial information that individuals can retrieve from participating banks and 
government agencies. This provides individuals with a more comprehensive view of their 
financial positions. The inclusion of CDP information in SGFinDex was achieved through close 
collaboration with the Singapore Exchange (SGX), participating banks and the Association of 
Banks in Singapore (ABS). In the next phase, individuals can look forward to accessing 
information on their insurance policies through SGFinDex as well. 

Mr Lim Tuang Lee, Assistant Managing Director (Capital Markets), MAS said, “The 
inclusion of CDP data in SGFinDex is an important step to providing Singaporeans with a more 
holistic view of their financial portfolio, empowering them to make better financial decisions 
and enhance retirement planning.” 

Mr Kendrick Lee, Director, National Digital Identity, Government Technology Agency 
(GovTech) added, “We are delighted that the close partnership SNDGG has with our industry 
partners has equipped Singaporeans with more robust digital solutions for their financial 
needs. We seek to expand on such initiatives to drive and improve consent-based data-driven 
innovations and build trusted online ecosystems for better lives in Smart Nation Singapore.” 

Mr Daniel Hildebrand, Head of Digital & Depository Services, SGX said, “CDP provides 
integrated clearing, settlement and depository services for a wide range of products in 
Singapore’s securities market and its data form a critical part of investors’ overall financial 
portfolio. We are supporting our account holders to better view and plan their finances by 
providing CDP data through SGFinDex, a platform offered jointly by MAS and SNDGG to 
enable individuals to improve their financial planning.”

**About the Singapore Financial Data Exchange** 

The Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex) is the world's first public digital 
infrastructure to use a national digital identity and centrally managed online consent system 
to enable individuals to access, through applications, their financial information held across 
different government agencies and financial institutions.

SGFinDex is designed with data protection and privacy controls in place for personal 
information. Financial data can be retrieved only with the explicit consent of the individual 
through Singpass, and individuals retain control over which participating entities they wish to 
share their data with. An individual’s consent to link participating entities to SGFinDex lasts 
for only one year from the time of his first account linkage to SGFinDex. His consent needs to 
be given again after a year.
