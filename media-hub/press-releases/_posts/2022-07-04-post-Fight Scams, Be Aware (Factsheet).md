## Fight Scams. Be Aware.

**4 Jul 2022**

The Government is actively fighting scams, which is increasingly common due to technological advancements. Yet while the tactics may change, the heart of these attacks remain the same – exploiting victims’ fears and hopes.

We are already implementing a range of measures, from running fraud analytics to detect suspicious logins, to working with telcos to block scam websites, SMSes and calls. But an important line of defence against scams is a vigilant public with the know-how to recognise
legitimate Government websites and URL links sent by agencies.

### Tech Tip

Here are three quick steps to remember each time you come across a
webpage or URL that says it comes from the Singapore Government.

#### Stop

Before you enter a website or click on a website link that appears to be sent by the Government, don’t click on it straightaway. Look carefully at the URL first.

#### Check

Make sure the domain of the URL ends with “.gov.sg”.

#### Go

If the website or URL link checks out, proceed.

If it does not, you should be careful, and check the website’s domain here: [www.gov.sg/trusted-sites](https://www.gov.sg/trusted-sites)

All the websites listed are legitimate, even if they don’t have the “.gov.sg” domain.
