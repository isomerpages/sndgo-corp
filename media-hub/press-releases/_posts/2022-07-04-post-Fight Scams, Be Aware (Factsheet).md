## Factsheet – Fight Scams. Be Aware.

**4 Jul 2022**

The Government is actively fighting scams, which is increasingly common due to technological advancements. Yet while the tactics may change, the heart of these attacks remain the same – exploiting victims’ fears and hopes.

We are already implementing a range of measures, from running fraud analytics to detect suspicious logins, to working with telcos to block scam websites, SMSes and calls. But an important line of defence against scams is a vigilant public with the know-how to recognise
legitimate Government websites and URL links sent by agencies.

### Tech Tip

Here are three quick steps to remember each time you come across a
webpage or URL that says it comes from the Singapore Government.

#### Stop

#### Check

#### Go

### Asking for your credentials

Similarly, any log-ins to Government services should only be done at websites with domains ending with “.gov.sg”.

There are exceptions to the rule. Some websites are collaborations between Government agencies and non-government organisations, and are not using the “.gov.sg” domain. There are also other Government-associated websites such as the National Dental Centre Singapore’s e-services page that are exceptions. These exceptions are listed on [www.gov.sg/trusted-sites](https://www.gov.sg/trusted-sites.).

**Example of website without “.gov.sg” in URL requesting for user log-ins:**

Be wary of sites that claim to be Government websites and request that you log in, yet do not have domains ending with “.gov.sg”. Always err on the side of caution when in doubt.
