## Smart Nation and Digital Government Group Partners with Google Cloud to Enhance AI Innovation in Singapore

*First public-private partnership in the field of AI between Singapore’s National AI Office and a global technology company to co-create solutions, deepen AI capabilities in public service, and shape AI governance and ethics*

**23 Aug 2022**

Singapore’s Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) have inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to strengthen AI cooperation in Singapore. The MOU is led by Singapore’s National AI Office and is its first public-private AI partnership with a global technology company.  
  
The MOU outlines three specific areas of collaboration:

1. **Applied Research and Development (R&D)** – Google Cloud and Alphabet’s subsidiaries will work closely with SNDGG’s National AI Office and other government agencies to co-create, test-bed, and scale AI solutions in key sectors like finance, sustainability, and healthcare.

2. **Competency and Capability Development** – Google Cloud will provide dedicated training resources and certification programs to cultivate deep AI and machine learning proficiency for identified public sector officers. These programs reinforce Google Cloud’s commitment to bridging the AI talent gap, and will build on Google’s [Skills Ignition SG training program](https://grow.google/intl/ALL_sg/skillsignitionsg/?tab=google-career%20certificates) in partnership with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). They will also complement Google Cloud’s contribution to the [recent collaboration](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/artificial-intelligence-free-training-programme-students-aisg-2841201/) between AI Singapore (AISG) and Singapore’s Ministry of Education (MOE) to give local students a headstart in pursuing STEM careers.

3. **AI Governance and Ethics** – Google Cloud will support the Singapore government’s efforts to shape AI governance and ethics in key sectors like finance. These efforts complement Google’s involvement in Singapore’s Advisory Council of the Ethical Use of AI, and its contributions to the [Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organizations](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/resource-for-organisation/ai/sgisago.ashx) and [Model AI Governance Framework](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/resource-for-organisation/ai/sgmodelaigovframework2.ashx). Together, these efforts will help to manage new forms of risks that will emerge as AI becomes more pervasive.

"This MOU is a win-win collaboration. Singapore will benefit from Google’s deep technical expertise and investments, while Google can tap on our rich innovation ecosystem. Singapore can also be a test-bed for Google’s efforts to trial new solutions safely, before introducing them to the region and beyond. With the MOU, we can look forward to novel AI solutions that will make an impact on the way Singaporeans – and people around the world – live and work. This is one of the many examples of how the public service and private sector can come together to undertake innovative projects for the greater good,” said Dr Chng Zhenzhi, Director, National AI Office, SNDGG.

“Already [recognized as a leading smart city](https://www.imd.org/smart-city-observatory/home/#_smartCity), Singapore has continued to grow in stature as a global center of AI innovation and real-world application. It is a privilege to be the first technology company to enter into a partnership with SNDGG’s National AI Office to co-develop and deploy new AI solutions of value and relevance to Singaporeans and the future economy. Through this public-private collaboration in the field of AI, we aim to advance the technology’s ability to deliver greater societal benefit in areas like financial inclusion, carbon footprint reduction, and personalized healthcare, while ensuring equity, privacy, transparency, and accountability,” said Sherie Ng, Country Director, Singapore and Malaysia, Google Cloud.
