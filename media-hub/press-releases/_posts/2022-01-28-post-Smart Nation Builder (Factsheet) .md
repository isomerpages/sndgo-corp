## Factsheet - Smart Nation Builder

**28 Jan 2022**

The Smart Nation Builder was launched by Minister for Communications and Information, Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Josephine Teo at the Smart Nation Ambassadors (SNA) Appreciation Event today.

Designed as a roving showcase, the 12m truck is fitted with eight interactive game stations for members of the public to learn about our Smart Nation initiatives and digital government services such as LifeSG, Parents Gateway app, Healthy365 and the NLB mobile app. It is also a space for the public to share feedback on existing products and services and tell us which digital services they would like to see more of in areas such as healthcare, community services and education.

At the Smart Nation Builder, members of the public can also be the first to try prototypes of new digital products, and help us improve the user interface, accessibility, and overall user experience for these upcoming products.

The roving Smart Nation Builder will be travelling to the heartlands, community spaces, shopping malls and public libraries from the second half of 2022. Details of the deployment schedule will be shared on Smart Nation Singapore’s social media pages.

Together with CityScape@URA1[^1] and PlayScape@Science Centre[^2], the Smart Nation Builder is one of three showcases by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) to help our people experience and understand the benefits of technology. As we move towards greater digitalisation, more efforts must be made to make our digital services inclusive and accessible for everyone. The Smart Nation Builder will provide a continuing platform to take in citizens’ input and feedback for better digital government products.
