<h2>Factsheet - Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiatives launched to uplift Singapore’s economic potential</h2>
<p><strong>1 March 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>At the Committee of Supply (COS) Debates 2024, MCI-SN announced several
AI initiatives to power Singapore’s next bound of economic growth, including:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a) New initiatives to nurture AI research talent;</p>

the number of SG Digital Scholarships and overseas internships in AI roles;</p>
<p>c) An investment of up to $500 million into securing high-performance
compute resources for AI innovation and capability building;</p>
<p>d) Launching a Generative AI x for Digital Leaders Initiative to provide

<p></p>
<p>These initiatives align with the refreshed National AI Strategy (NAIS
2.0) launched by Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Lawrence Wong in December
2023. NAIS 2.0 aims to propel Singapore as a leader in the field of AI,
and to use AI for the public good, for Singapore and the world.</p>
<p>To support NAIS 2.0 and further catalyse AI activities, DPM Wong announced
- through his Budget Statement on 16 Feb 2024 – an investment of more than
$1 billion over the next five years into AI compute, talent, and industry
development.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals of NAIS 2.0, we have begun directing our efforts
towards three systems - activity drivers; people and communities; infrastructure
and environment - by working through 10 enablers. The abovementioned initiatives
relate to the following enablers that are the key focus for 2024.</p>
