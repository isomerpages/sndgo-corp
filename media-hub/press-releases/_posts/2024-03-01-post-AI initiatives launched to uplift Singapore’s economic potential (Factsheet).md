<h2>Factsheet - Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiatives launched to uplift Singapore’s economic potential</h2>
<p><strong>1 March 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>At the Committee of Supply (COS) Debates 2024, MCI announced several AI
initiatives to power Singapore’s next bound of economic growth, including:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a) New initiatives to nurture AI research talent;</p>
<p>b) An investment of over $20 million in the next three years to increase
the number of SG Digital Scholarships and overseas internships in AI roles;</p>
<p>c) An investment of up to $500 million into securing high-performance
compute resources for AI innovation and capability building;</p>
<p>d) Launching a Generative AI x Digital Leaders Initiative to provide businesses
with access to GenAI expertise and resources; and</p>
<p>e) The publication of Advisory Guidelines on the use of Personal Data
in AI Recommendation and Decision Systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These initiatives align with the refreshed National AI Strategy (NAIS
2.0) launched by Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Lawrence Wong in December
2023. NAIS 2.0 aims to propel Singapore as a leader in the field of AI,
and to use AI for the public good, for Singapore and the world.</p>
<p>To support NAIS 2.0 and further catalyse AI activities, DPM Wong announced
- through his Budget Statement on 16 Feb 2024 – an investment of more than
$1 billion over the next five years into AI compute, talent, and industry
development.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals of NAIS 2.0, we have begun directing our efforts
towards three systems - activity drivers; people and communities; infrastructure
and environment - by working through 10 enablers. The abovementioned initiatives
relate to the following enablers that are the key focus for 2024.</p>
<h4>Enabler 1: Talent</h4>
<p>A key focus is the building of skilled AI talent in Singapore. Such talent
can be categorised in three groups – (i) Creators, who are top-tier talent
engaged in novel and cutting-edge AI activities; (ii) Practitioners, which
include data and machine learning scientists and engineers involved in
the translation and development of AI solutions; and (iii) Users of AI-powered
products and services.</p>
<p>As an initial step to nurture a pool of top-tier AI Creators:</p>
<p>a) The government will launch a new AI Visiting Professorship to attract
world-class AI researchers to establish collaborations with Singapore.
Refer to Annex A for more details.</p>
<p>b) The government will invest S$7 million into a new AI Accelerated Masters
Programme in collaboration with local universities to build up our own
pipeline of Singaporean AI researchers. Refer to Annex B for more details.</p>
<p>As for AI practitioners, we will level up and triple the pool of practitioners
to 15,000 over 5 years to support growing AI demand. As an initial step
towards this goal, the government will invest over $20 million to enhance
AI Practitioner training for students over three years, including an increase
in the number of AI-related SG Digital Scholarships for Singaporeans to
pursue AI and related undergraduate, masters, and PhD courses in top universities,
and facilitate access to overseas internships in AI-related roles. These
scholarships will allow students to work in the industry after graduation,
while the internships will provide students with opportunities to gain
industry exposure and apply their knowledge and skills to solve real-world
problems. This is in addition to the ramping up of our Continuous Education
and Training programmes under our TeSA initiative to provide pathways for
mid-careerists to transit to AI jobs. Refer to Annex C for more details.</p>
<h4>Enabler 2: Industry</h4>
<p>On the industry front, MCI announced at COS 2023 that it would be developing
a Digital Enterprise Blueprint (DEB) to chart the next bound of enterprise
digitalisation in Singapore, including catalysing enterprise experimentation
and innovation with emerging technologies like AI (Refer to Media Factsheet:
2 of 4 for more details).</p>
<p>Currently, for enterprises that are ready to experiment with and deploy
more advanced digital solutions, the government has put in place enablers
to support them. Various initiatives have been developed to make Generative
AI (GenAI) more accessible to SMEs to unlock productivity gains. For example,
enterprises looking to experiment with GenAI can gain experience with curated
GenAI solutions on the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sme-gen-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GenAI Sandbox for SMEs.</a>
</p>
<p>For enterprises that are digitally more mature, IMDA has launched the <strong>Generative AI x Digital Leaders initiative </strong>to
provide them with access to GenAI expertise and resources to better understand
GenAI and further build their capabilities to implement customised GenAI
applications with tech partners to meet their business needs. Refer to
Annex D for more details of this initiative.</p>
