## National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2.0 to Uplift Singapore's Social and Economic Potential

**04 December 2023**

Singapore’s second National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0) was officially launched today by Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong to address the challenges of our time, and uplift Singapore’s collective economic and social potential over the next three to five years. The strategy was unveiled at the opening dinner of the inaugural Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI), which was attended by over 100 local and overseas AI experts from academia, industry, and government.

### Singapore’s Renewed National AI Strategy

In 2019, Singapore published our first National AI Strategy, outlining plans to deepen the use of AI to transform our economy. To demonstrate the usefulness of AI, we embarked on national AI projects in areas like Education, Healthcare, and Safety & Security. We also invested in enablers to strengthen our AI ecosystem.

Since then, we have seen remarkable breakthroughs in AI in the form of new products, capabilities, and interactions. AI presents both opportunities and risks for Singapore, where our people interact with digital technologies every day. Mastering AI will empower our businesses and citizens to harness new job opportunities and create new value, unlocking our next frontier of economic growth. However, AI must be managed responsibly and sustainably, to guard against potential ill effects or misuse that exacerbate existing challenges such as cyber threats and mis/disinformation, so that everyone can engage with AI safely and confidently.

In this new era of AI, the Singapore Government’s updated NAIS 2.0 outlines our ambition and commitment to building a trusted and responsible AI ecosystem, driving innovation and growth through AI, and empowering our people and businesses to understand and engage with AI. Guided by the vision “AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World”, NAIS 2.0 focuses on two key goals:

i) **Excellence**: Singapore will selectively develop peaks of excellence in AI, to advance the field and maximise value creation. We intend to direct AI towards addressing the needs and challenges of our time, such as in areas of global importance like population health and climate change.

ii) **Empowerment**: Singapore will raise up individuals, businesses, and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment, and trust. We intend for AI to be the great equaliser, which equips our people and businesses with the capabilities and resources to thrive in an AI-enabled future.

Guided by these goals, Singapore will direct efforts under NAIS 2.0 toward three systems, working through 10 enablers:
