## National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2.0 to Uplift Singapore's Social and Economic Potential

**04 December 2023**

Singapore’s second National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0) was officially launched today by Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong to address the challenges of our time, and uplift Singapore’s collective economic and social potential over the next three to five years. The strategy was unveiled at the opening dinner of the inaugural Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI), which was attended by over 100 local and overseas AI experts from academia, industry, and government.

### Singapore’s Renewed National AI Strategy

In 2019, Singapore published our first National AI Strategy, outlining plans to deepen the use of AI to transform our economy. To demonstrate the usefulness of AI, we embarked on national AI projects in areas like Education, Healthcare, and Safety &amp; Security. We also invested in enablers to strengthen our AI ecosystem.

Since then, we have seen remarkable breakthroughs in AI in the form of new products, capabilities, and interactions. AI presents both opportunities and risks for Singapore, where our people interact with digital technologies every day. Mastering AI will empower our businesses and citizens to harness new job opportunities and create new value, unlocking our next frontier of economic growth. However, AI must be managed responsibly and sustainably, to guard against potential ill effects or misuse that exacerbate existing challenges such as cyber threats and mis/disinformation, so that everyone can engage with AI safely and confidently.

In this new era of AI, the Singapore Government’s updated NAIS 2.0 outlines our ambition and commitment to building a trusted and responsible AI ecosystem, driving innovation and growth through AI, and empowering our people and businesses to understand and engage with AI. Guided by the vision “AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World”, NAIS 2.0 focuses on two key goals:

i) **Excellence**: Singapore will selectively develop peaks of excellence in AI, to advance the field and maximise value creation. We intend to direct AI towards addressing the needs and challenges of our time, such as in areas of global importance like population health and climate change.

ii) **Empowerment**: Singapore will raise up individuals, businesses, and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment, and trust. We intend for AI to be the great equaliser, which equips our people and businesses with the capabilities and resources to thrive in an AI-enabled future.

Guided by these goals, Singapore will direct efforts under NAIS 2.0 toward three systems, working through 10 enablers:

NAIS 2.0 outlines 15 Actions that Singapore will undertake across these systems and enablers, to support our ambitions in AI over the next three to five years. We will continually review these Actions to respond to fast-moving developments in AI, across domains.

### Launch of Inaugural Singapore Conference on AI

The rapid advancement of AI has the potential to revolutionise industries and enhance our quality of life, transforming the way we live and work. However, there are many potential pitfalls in future AI development and deployment that may constrain our ability to harness the technology, e.g., accuracy, bias, and resource-efficiency. The ubiquity of AI technologies will also require drawing on multiple domains of expertise, to ensure AI can be unleashed for the benefit of societies.

To overcome these challenges, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and Smart Nation Group, in partnership with Topos Institute, are organising the inaugural SCAI from 4 to 6 December 2023. The conference, themed “For the Global Good”, aims to bring together over 40 distinguished experts from various fields of academia, industry, and government to identify the critical questions of AI, that, if answered, will enable AI to truly be developed and deployed for the global good.

The conference will focus on articulating these critical questions - including the importance and actionability of these challenges, as well as how to measure progress in addressing them. It is our hope that the development of these SCAI Questions will inspire global talent and focus the world’s attention on tackling these critical questions of AI. On 6 December, SCAI delegates will hold a press conference to announce the SCAI Questions.
