## Factsheet – GoWhere Suite

**3 Mar 2022**

The GoWhere suite of websites was created by GovTech’s Government Digital Services (GDS) team to address the need for rapid and reliable sources of information during the COVID-19 pandemic. It supports location/eligibility-based information queries, serves as a portal to disseminate information to the public, and as a tech interface for government distribution operations.

The GoWhere application stack can be easily adapted to support various government distribution exercises. The success of MaskGoWhere with over 5.5 million visits over three rounds of mask distribution led other government agencies to collaborate with GovTech to develop their own GoWhere sites, including SGTogetherPackGoWhere (MINDEF) and SupportGoWhere (MSF).

GoWhere has been used in 16 government initiatives and registered more than 34 million website visits as of January 2022. Currently, it includes the following websites:

* **GoWhere Directory:** one-stop resource hub for all official COVID-19 related information.

* **SupportGoWhere:** one-stop resource hub to discover and self-check your eligibility for Government support schemes.

* **TokenGoWhere:** find TraceTogether Token collection locations & vending machines nearest to you.

* **PosterGoWhere:** poster generator to produce standardised, multilingual posters with the most up-to-date information on TraceTogether Token distribution exercises.

* **ARTGoWhere:** find Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kit collection locations and vending machine nearest to you.

* **FluGoWhere:** locate Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) nearest to you.

* **CDCVouchersMerchantsGoWhere:** discover where to spend your CDC vouchers by searching for the nearest participating hawkers and heartland merchants.

* **MaskGoWhere:** find mask collection locations nearest to you. (Mask distribution has concluded since 14 June 2020.)
PassGoWhere: allow workers to apply for Dormitory Exit Passes to leave their dormitories for leisure or personal purposes.

* **TestCentreGoWhere:** locate Quick Test Centres (QTCs) and Combined Test Centres (CTCs) nearest to you.

#### Why GoWhere?

The COVID-19 pandemic was, and continues to be, volatile and rapidly evolving. This meant that the guidelines and measures in response to the pandemic are also constantly being updated. As a result, individuals and businesses have found it difficult to keep up with the latest information from multiple agencies. As a one-stop resource hub for all COVID-19 related information, the GoWhere Directory facilitates citizens’ and businesses’ access to quick and reliable information during the pandemic.

The pandemic also necessitated unprecedented nationwide distribution efforts. GoWhere’s suite of websites, such as ARTGoWhere and TokenGoWhere, facilitates these nationwide distribution efforts using location-based information queries/discoveries.

#### What’s next?

Beyond the Covid-19 pandemic, GovTech will continue to work with Government agencies to leverage the GoWhere application stack where suitable. For example, we are working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), National Council of Social Service (NCSS), SG Enable (SGE), and Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to explore the expansion of SupportGoWhere as a one-stop social assistance portal. SupportGoWhere has also been updated to reflect the latest Budget 2022 support schemes.
