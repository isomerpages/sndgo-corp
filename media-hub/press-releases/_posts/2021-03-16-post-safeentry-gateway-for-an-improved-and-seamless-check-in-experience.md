Singapore residents will soon have another convenient way to perform SafeEntry (SE) check-in with their TraceTogether (TT) Token or App. The new SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW), developed by GovTech, enables contactless detection of both App and Token to facilitate seamless check-ins. It will also help to check that the TT Token battery has not run out.

## Additional SafeEntry check-in method with the SEGW

2 The existing SafeEntry (Business) App that many venue operators already use will be upgraded to include the SEGW functionality. Venue operators may also opt to use a physical device (called the SEGW Box). Both the SEGW Box and app perform the same function.

3 TT users need only bring their TT Token, or mobile phone with the TT App in the foreground, to within 25 cm of the SEGW for contactless check in (similar to EZ link cards). The SEGW Box will emit a green light and a beep to indicate a successful check-in. The upgraded SafeEntry (Business) App will show a green screen on the venue operator’s mobile device. Please refer to  [Annex A (pdf - 170kb)](/files/press-releases/2021/sndgg-press-release-safeentry-gateway-launch-annex-a.pdf)  and  [Annex B (pdf - 181kb)](/files/press-releases/2021/sndgg-press-release-safeentry-gateway-launch-annex-b.pdf)  for illustrations.

## Existing modes of SE check-in to remain in place 

4 Existing modes of SE check-in will remain in place at venues required to deploy SEGW. Older mobile phone models that may not work well with SEGW can continue to use these existing modes to check in.

## SEGW to be first deployed at venues with high visitor traffic

5 From 19 April 2021, selected venues with high visitorship, such as malls, large standalone retail stores, cinemas, hospitals, polyclinics and MICE venues hosting events with more than 100 participants, etc., will be required to deploy SEGW (either the SEGW Box or app), in addition to pre-existing SafeEntry check-in methods.

6 Business operators may visit the SafeEntry website (<a href="www.safeentry.gov.sg" target="_blank">www.safeentry.gov.sg</a>) to check if they are required to deploy SEGWs at their venues. These businesses may choose to use the SEGW function on the SafeEntry (Business) app or apply to receive the SEGW Box.

## Importance of ensuring the Token is in working condition 

7 The TT Token battery is expected to last 4-6 months, depending on the Token variant. TT Token users can check if their Token is working by looking out for a green light that blinks about once every minute. If the Token is blinking red, or when there is no light at all, the Token needs to be replaced. Please refer to  [Annex C (pdf - 125kb)](/files/press-releases/2021/sndgg-press-release-safeentry-gateway-launch-annex-c.pdf)  for an illustration.

8 For effective digital contact tracing, non-working Tokens should be replaced immediately. Users should immediately bring their Token that is out of battery or is faulty to any CC to exchange for a free replacement. From April 2021, Token replacement stations will be set up at some venues where we will roll out the SEGW, so that Tokens discovered by the SEGW to be not transmitting Bluetooth signals can be expeditiously replaced.

9 For lost Tokens, the first reissuance is free but subsequent reissuance would be liable for a charge to account for the cost of the Token.

## Summary

10 To date, more than 3 million TT Tokens have been distributed. The roll-out of SEGW will help check for Tokens that are faulty or have run out of battery, while also enhancing convenience for TT Programme users.
