<h2>Factsheet - New Digital Infrastructure Act to enhance the resilience &amp; security of digital infrastructure and services</h2>
<p>At COS 2024, MCI announced that the inter-agency Taskforce on the Resilience
and Security of Digital Infrastructure and Services (“Taskforce”) is studying
the introduction of a Digital Infrastructure Act (DIA) to enhance the resilience
and security of key digital infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>Today, the cybersecurity and resilience of critical information infrastructure
(“CII”),[1] which are computers or computer systems necessary for the continuous
delivery of essential services, are governed by the Cybersecurity Act (“CS
Act”). The CS Act is supplemented by relevant sector regulation (e.g.,
CII in the telecommunications sector are additionally governed by the Telecommunications
Act). Recent disruptions, such as the four-hour Equinix data centre outage
on 14 Oct 2023, did not result from cyber- attacks but had nonetheless
resulted in widespread disruption of banking services. Hence, it is necessary
for the Government to go beyond the CS Act to enhance the resilience and
security of other digital infrastructure and services that enterprises
and citizens rely heavily on in our highly digitalised economy and society.
While the risk of disruptions cannot be eliminated entirely, the Taskforce
has been reviewing the evolving risk landscape, studying measures deployed
by other countries which are similarly facing these issues, and developing
measures suited to Singapore’s context.</p>
<p>The DIA is one such measure that the Taskforce is developing. The DIA
is intended to complement the Government’s other regulatory levers, such
as the CS Act which focuses on mitigating cyber-related risks.[2] It will
go beyond cybersecurity to address a broader set of resilience risks faced
by digital infrastructure and service providers, ranging from misconfigurations
in technical architecture, to physical hazards such as fires, water leaks,
and cooling system failures.</p>
<p>In scoping the DIA, the Taskforce is studying the digital infrastructure
ecosystem in Singapore to identify those which would have a systemic impact
on Singapore’s economy and society if disrupted. Examples include data
centres and cloud services, and support the delivery of many widely-used
digital services (e.g., banking and payments, ride-hailing, and digital
identities).</p>
<p>The Taskforce is also formulating the requirements that the regulated
entities would be subject to under the DIA. This will take into account
Singapore’s operating context as well as international developments. For
example, jurisdictions such as the European Union (EU), Germany and Australia
have introduced incident reporting requirements and baseline resilience
and security standards which regulated entities must comply with. The incident
reporting requirements would deepen the Government’s situational awareness
and understanding of systemic risk when disruptions occur. Collectively,
these requirements could contribute to the prevention of disruptions and
effective recovery should disruptions occur.</p>
<p>The Taskforce will continue to consult industry players and other relevant
stakeholders as it develops its proposals. It is mindful of the need to
ensure coherence in requirements and processes (e.g., reporting channels)
across different regulatory levers. It will also balance trade-offs, such
as those between risk mitigation and compliance costs, and between tailoring
interventions to Singapore’s context and accounting for global operations
of many providers.</p>
<p>Regulation alone is insufficient. The Taskforce is therefore exploring
non-regulatory measures to complement Singapore’s laws. These could include
providing guidance to digital infrastructure and service providers on best
practices for resilience and security to ensure business continuity.</p>
<h3>About the Taskforce</h3>
<p>The formation of the Taskforce was announced by Minister for Communications
and Information, Mrs Josephine Teo, earlier this year on 4 January. The
Taskforce’s overarching objective is to uphold public trust and confidence
in digital infrastructure and services in Singapore. The Taskforce will
review the evolving landscape of resilience and security risks to digital
infrastructure and services, and recommend measures and policies to mitigate
cybersecurity risks and raise resiliency standards.</p>
<p>As an inter-agency effort, the Taskforce is led by the Ministry of Communications
and Information, and comprises members from Smart Nation Group, Cyber Security
Agency of Singapore, Infocomm Media Development Authority, and Government
Technology Agency. Relevant sector agencies (e.g., regulators of digital
services with systemic impact on Singapore’s economic activity and the
public’s daily lives) will also be consulted.</p>

<p>[1] CII sectors include: Energy, Water, Banking and Finance, Healthcare,
Transport (including Land, Maritime, Aviation), Infocomm, Media, Security
and Emergency Services, Government.
<br>[2] As part of upcoming amendments, the Cybersecurity Act’s scope will
be expanded beyond CII to regulate the foundational digital infrastructure
(e.g., Cloud Service Providers and Data Centres) and key entities that
hold sensitive data and perform important public functions.</p>
