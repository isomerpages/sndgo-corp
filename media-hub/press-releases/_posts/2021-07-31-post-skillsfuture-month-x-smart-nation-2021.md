The SkillsFuture Month X Smart Nation (SFM X SN) is back and aims to encourage more Singaporeans, particularly those without a tech background, to consider a career in the growing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector. Minister for Communication and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Josephine Teo launched the second edition of the event at Our Tampines Hub today.  

## STRONG GROWTH IN ICT SECTOR AND MANY TECH JOBS AVAILABLE
  
2\. The hybrid SFM X SN 2021 event comprises two physical roadshows and a series of free digital skills webinars. Together, the roadshows and webinars seek to engage citizens, especially those without prior tech experience or training, to (i) learn about digital skills that are in demand, (ii) identify training opportunities and skills gaps, and (iii) pick up digital and tech skills to help them find jobs and opportunities in the ICT sector.

3\. The ICT sector has registered strong growth even amid the COVID-19 situation. In 2020, the Information and Communications sector was one of several sectors that registered positive growth in employment[1].  *Good jobs are available in this sector. * Under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills package, more than 13,600 jobseekers have been placed into jobs, company-hosted traineeships and attachments, as well as training opportunities in the ICT sector as of February 2021. There remains over 18,000 of these opportunities on offer.

4\. Tech companies are growing their product lines to meet the needs of consumers from a wide spread of sectors, including sustainability, aviation, transport, and F&B. *Workers with both the digital skills and the experience to apply these skills to a particular sector are in demand.*

5\. *Jobs are also available for workers without formal technical training.* According to the Jobs Situation Report for the ICT sector published in November 2020[2], about 1 in 3 jobs in the ICT sector are tech-lite jobs that do not require formal certification.

## ROADSHOWS TO SUPPORT SINGAPOREANS TO LAUNCH A NEW CAREER IN TECH, OR UPSKILL FOR CAREER GROWTH

6\. The two roadshows will be held at Our Tampines Hub (30 July to 1 August) and HDB Hub (6 to 8 August). At the roadshows, visitors will be able to find out what are the in-demand digital and tech skills, get help to develop personalised training plans, and sign up for tech-related webinars after speaking with the skills and training ambassadors.

7\. The roadshows are divided into 3 zones:

### Explore Zone: 
Individuals will learn about digital and tech skills that are in demand by employers, according to research findings by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), NTUC LearningHub, and SNDGO. These are key skills that workers and job seekers can consider equipping themselves with to add value to their current jobs or give them an edge when seeking new jobs. There is a range of skills to cater to the wide base of public who might be interested, including marketing and creative services, data-driven decision making, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and cyber security. Visitors will also gain a better understanding on how the SGUnited Jobs and Skills initiatives and SkillsFuture initiatives can improve their employability and lead to more employment opportunities.

### Discover Zone: 
SSG Skills Ambassadors will be on-hand to provide personal skills and training advice, helping individuals identify their digital and tech skills needs. They will then help to develop personalised training plans to support the individual’s career transition or progression. e2i career consultants will also be present to help individuals learn how to enhance their employability to access career opportunities in the tech sector.

### Act Zone: 
Individuals can sign up for tech and digital webinars offered by training providers such as the Lithan Academy, NTUC LearningHub, and the Singapore Computer Society. In addition, members of the public can visit the IMDA booth to enquire about job and training opportunities offered under the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) initiative. This initiative supports both tech and non-tech professionals in their journey to upgrade and acquire new tech skills and domain knowledge.

## FREE WEBINARS COVERING THE TECH-LITE TO THE SPECIALISED
