Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), the technology agency for Singapore healthcare, has today called for greater collaboration across various industries to co-create Smart Health solutions to transform healthcare and improve population health. MOH’s three strategic shifts in moving care beyond the hospital to the community, beyond healthcare to health, and beyond quality to value aim to combat the challenges of a rapidly growing ageing population, increasing chronic disease burden, and shrinking workforce that is faced by many developed cities around the globe.

Mr Bruce Liang, Chief Executive Officer of IHiS and Chief Information Officer at MOH, shared: “MOH's three shifts, new healthcare facilities under development, consolidation of healthcare backend systems, and IT resiliency requirements have opened up significant opportunities for the industry. Over the next five years, we expect to increase our procurement of IT services and technologies by at least 25%.”

Smart Health contributes to Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative to improve citizens’ lives through technology. The objectives of Smart Health are to empower citizens to better manage their health and encourage them to adopt healthier lifestyles, as well as enable healthcare professionals to deliver better care by predicting and identifying those who need early intervention and when to do so, enhancing continuity of care, improving health outcomes, boosting effectiveness of care programmes, and improving productivity.

Co-creation opportunities highlighted by IHiS at the Smart Nation Industry Briefing include nudging through behavioural science to improve population health, disease prevention and management programmes, home diagnostic toolsets for self-triage, non-invasive, non-intrusive and ubiquitous monitoring, assistive robots, predictive models and near real-time surveillance of diseases and services, and more.
