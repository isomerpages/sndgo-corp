Agencies issue Request for Information for e-payment solutions in hawker centres, HDB coffee shops and shops

*JOINT NEWS RELEASE BETWEEN HDB, MAS, SNDGO AND NEA*

The National Environment Agency (NEA), Housing & Development Board (HDB), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) have jointly issued a Request for Information (RFI) for electronic payment (e-payment) solutions to support micro-payments mainly at hawker centres, HDB coffee shops, and shops in the heartlands. This is in line with the national drive towards an electronic payments society in Singapore, as part of the Smart Nation vision.

2          Smart Nation is not about the technology per se but leveraging technology to improve lives. With most Singaporeans frequenting hawker centres and HDB shops on a regular basis, the aim is to provide them with an e-payment solution that is not just easy and convenient, but a delight to use. Given the low-value transactions in these places, the solution must be affordable for the merchants, for payments between them and their customers and between them and their suppliers.

3          The Government is keen to work with industry players to develop e-payments solutions that can be adopted by a broad demographic of customers, merchants and suppliers quickly, affordably and safely. The agencies are crowd-sourcing views and ideas through this RFI, in line with the Smart Nation principle of harnessing the innovation and creativity of the private sector and co-creating solutions.

4          The insights gained through the RFI will help facilitate preparations by NEA, HDB, MAS and SNDGO, for subsequent Request for Proposal or other procurement process for e-payment solutions at hawker centres, HDB coffee shops and shops. Interested parties can access the RFI on GeBiz from today. The closing date for submission is 15 September 2017.
