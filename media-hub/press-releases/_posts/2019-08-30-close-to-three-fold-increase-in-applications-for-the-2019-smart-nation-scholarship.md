1. The Smart Nation Scholarship was presented to 14 recipients by Mr S Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity, at the Smart Nation Scholarship award ceremony today.

2. The scholars were selected from a bumper crop of 614 applications, a nearly three-fold increase from the 233 applications in 2018. Nine students received the inaugural scholarship last year.

3. Jointly offered by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the Smart Nation Scholarship aims to identify and develop promising young talents to boost Singapore’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capabilities. Scholarship recipients will pursue undergraduate studies at reputable local and overseas universities in various disciplines, from computer science, information security, business analytics to law.

4. Of the 14 recipients, eight will join GovTech, while CSA and IMDA will each be awarding three scholars. The recipients will play a critical role in shaping Singapore’s ICT ecosystem to chart our Smart Nation journey. They will be groomed for various ICT leadership roles in the public sector and work on a diverse range of projects that will benefit the nation.

5. The recipients were selected through a rigorous assessment process comprising aptitude tests, management interviews, and agency-specific assessments such as technical and gamified personality tests. They were assessed beyond academic results for qualities such as their passion for technology, and dedication to public service.

6. “Since young, I have been drawn to cybersecurity competitions, which offer exciting and unique puzzles to be solved. As I became more involved in cybersecurity, I saw how vulnerable we are to cyber threats and I realised that my passion could be put to good use if I pursue a cybersecurity career. The Scholarship would allow me to learn from the experts and gain well-rounded experience. I hope to utilise what I have learnt to help people and protect my nation,” said Silas Yeo. Silas is one of three recipients who will be joining CSA. He is an avid developer of game applications, and has created an application to help the visually-impaired use smartphones. Silas has participated actively in various competitions such as NUS Hack and Roll, the Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp and IoT-Capture the Flag organised by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

7. “The Smart Nation Scholarship will give me the opportunity to use technology to innovate solutions for the public and improve their lives. This has been what I’m passionate about, and I look forward to joining GovTech in a few years’ time,” said Choy Yi Jing, who graduated with a Diploma in Visual Communications and Media Design from Singapore Polytechnic. Yi Jing is among the eight recipients who will be joining GovTech. She is also an active volunteer for the elderly, and has researched and designed a revamped funeral service and management platform to improve its user friendliness.

8. “In a world that is constantly shaped by rapid advancements in technology, we need to understand the implications of these developments on the legal landscape and the policies that need to be put in place to protect our society. With the Smart Nation Scholarship, I can combine my two passions ― in law and technology ― to create and shape policies that can realise Singapore’s Smart Nation vision,” said Johanna Lim Ziyun, who is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Laws at National University of Singapore (NUS). Johanna is one of three recipients who will be joining IMDA. Johanna currently works pro bono to impart legal knowledge to budding youths, and is interested in intellectual property, technology and international law.
