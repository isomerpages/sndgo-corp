## Factsheet - Smart Nation Ambassadors Citizen Co-Creation Group

**28 Jan 2022**

The Smart Nation Ambassadors (SNA) Citizen Co-Creation Group was launched by Minister for Communications and Information, Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Josephine Teo at the SNA Appreciation Event today.

Convened by the Smart Nation & Digital Government Group (SNDGG), the SNA Citizen Co-Creation Group will be made up of Smart Nation Ambassadors who are community leaders representing diverse groups, including persons with disabilities, low-income families, seniors, clan associations and SMEs.

SNDGG aims to organise two open dialogue sessions for the SNA Citizen Co-Creation Group in a year. Through these discussions, representatives will be able to give input on behalf of their community, so that our digital government policies and services can take into consideration the needs of the community from the onset. Topics of discussion could include Smart City solutions for the neighbourhood, and ways to address gaps on digital inclusion for low-income families and persons with disabilities.

Community representatives will also be invited to work with our engineering teams to co-develop tech solutions that tackle social and economic issues. This will foster greater co-ownership for Singapore’s Smart Nation outcomes.

SNDGG’s engineering teams will be able to tap into the community networks of the SNA Citizen Co-Creation Group for product testing. With the community’s participation and feedback in the development and user-testing of new digital products, we can continuously iterate our services for an improved user experience.

To date, 15 community groups such as Lions Befrienders and Society for the Physically Disabled have signed up to be part of the SNA Citizen Co-Creation Group. Please refer to Annex A for the list of community groups. SNDGG will be reaching out to more community groups to be added in the coming months. Groups that are keen to participate in the SNA Citizen Co-Creation Group can approach the Smart Nation & Digital Government Office at ambassadors@smartnation.gov.sg.
