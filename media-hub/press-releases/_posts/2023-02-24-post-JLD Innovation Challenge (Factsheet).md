## Factsheet – Jurong Lake District Innovation Challenge

**24 Feb 2023**

In a step towards achieving the vision to make Jurong Lake District a model sustainability district and a living lab to testbed green innovation, the Smart Nation & Digital Government Office (SNDGO) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), with the support of the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), are launching an innovation challenge for start-ups, private companies and research institutes to submit proposals to address complex urban sustainability issues.

The Jurong Lake District Innovation Challenge is a public-private collaboration where participating teams can propose urban solutions for challenge statements identified by the district’s stakeholders. The Challenge will focus on solutions that can reduce carbon emissions,
energy usage, waste and resources, and achieve a car-lite environment. Refer to [Annex A](/#annexa) for more information on the themes and challenge statements of the Jurong Lake District Innovation Challenge.

The proposals will be evaluated by a panel comprising representatives from relevant government agencies and stakeholders in the Jurong Lake District, including CapitaLand, Jurong Community Hospital, Lendlease Global Commercial REIT, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Science Centre Singapore and SMRT. There are six challenge statements and the winning teams will each be awarded a cash prize of $50,000. Temasek Foundation will also award a special cash prize of $50,000 to support one solution with significant game-changing potential on a pilot in Jurong Lake District.

Stakeholders may decide to run pilots of the winning solutions at their premises in and around the Jurong Lake District. Should these pilots prove to be effective, they may be scaled up to be deployed in the rest of the district and beyond, to benefit more developments and the wider public.

More details on the Challenge can be found at the IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform at www.openinnovation.sg/imda. The Open Innovation Platform is Singapore’s national platform for digital innovation, and has facilitated more than 300 challenges. Interested participants can submit their proposals from 24 February 2023 to 21 April 2023, 4pm SGT.

#### Annex A: Jurong Lake District Innovation Challenge themes

**Low carbon**

All new buildings in Jurong Lake District will be required to minimally achieve Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy) certification. Existing businesses are also actively seeking ways to reduce energy consumption in their buildings. Reducing the carbon footprint of the district will be a combined effort by residents, businesses and visitors; and should be made fun, educational and hassle-free.

The Science Centre Singapore is sponsoring the following challenge statement on gamifying sustainability:

* How might we design a system that promotes interest to monitor and manage sustainability-related information from multiple sources for visualisation and to encourage sustainable practices?
 
Lendlease Global Commercial REIT is sponsoring the following challenge statement on optimising energy usage:

* How might we design a smart building management system that can optimise energy consumption throughout the day while still delivering thermal comfort to building occupants?
 
Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital are co-sponsoring the following challenge statement on reducing energy consumption in hospitals:

* How might we optimise the performance and energy efficiency of existing Air Handling Units while ensuring good thermal comfort for patients and staff, and meeting hospital operational requirements?

**Waste management**

Jurong Lake District also supports the movement towards zero waste. More can be done to increase recycling rates by strengthening the effectiveness of strategies through the help of digitalisation.

CapitaLand is sponsoring the following challenge statement to find a way to collect and manage waste data at their premises:

* How might we design a digital solution that can collect, aggregate and report waste data from large commercial properties?

**Car-lite**

Today, getting to Jurong Lake District is convenient using the established public transport network. By the 2030s, Jurong Lake District will be even more connected with four MRT lines
serving it and at least 85% of all trips targeted to be made by Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport in 2035. We are seeking to implement a mix of strategies from infrastructural enhancements to behavioural nudges to make car-lite an integral part of everyone’s lifestyle choices in Jurong Lake District.

SMRT is sponsoring the following challenge statement to explore solutions in encouraging drivers to go car-lite and adopting Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport for trips within the Jurong Lake District:

* How might we encourage drivers to go car-lite and promote more Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport for trips within the Jurong Lake District?

**Water system optimisation**

Smart technologies and automation will support a more efficient and connected way to live and work and has the potential to conserve and optimise water resources. In the long run, it could also reduce reliance on manpower for repetitive tasks and enhance the well being of employees.

CapitaLand and Lendlease Global Commercial REIT are co-sponsoring the following challenge statement on using pre-emptive and predictive systems to improve the safety and productivity in maintenance work, while reducing the wastage of water resources in the process:

* How might we design a pre-emptive and predictive water tank monitoring system that reduces the need for corrective maintenance work?
