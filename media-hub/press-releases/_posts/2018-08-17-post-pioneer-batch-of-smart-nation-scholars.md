The Smart Nation Scholarship was awarded to nine recipients by Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-Charge of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, at the inaugural scholarship award ceremony today.

Launched in March 2018, the Smart Nation Scholarship offers a deep technical career path for scholars with a passion in applying technology for the public good. It seeks to develop and nurture a pool of next-generation leaders who will spearhead our national digital transformation.

 Singapore’s vision of a Smart Nation is aimed at enhancing a vibrant competitive economy with many new job opportunities, an inclusive society with a high quality of life and innovative responsive government services.

Dr. Balakrishnan said, “It is absolutely essential for us to attract top talent with deep digital skills for us to fulfil our Smart Nation ambitions. We will invest in our long-term engineering capabilities, to ensure that we have a core group of passionate innovators to lead and drive technology change, both within the civil service and across the private sector.”

The scholarship was awarded to students who have distinguished themselves beyond academic merits and leadership qualities. They were selected through a rigorous assessment process comprising aptitude tests, management interviews, and agency-specific assessment days.

Many of the pioneering cohort of scholars were self-taught in their technical knowledge and skills such as programming and data visualisation. They also showed their drive by participating, and excelling, in various ICT competitions and challenges.

The Smart Nation Scholarship recipients will be pursuing undergraduate studies in ICT-related disciplines, such as computer science, information security and mathematics, at reputable local and overseas universities.

The recipients will go on to undertake national projects in the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). They will be groomed for various information & communications technology (ICT) leadership roles in the public sector, with opportunities to work on a diverse range of cybersecurity work, and shape Singapore’s infocomm and media ecosystem.
