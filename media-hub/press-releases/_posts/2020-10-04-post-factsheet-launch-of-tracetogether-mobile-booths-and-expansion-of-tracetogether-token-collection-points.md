As Singapore looks to reopen its economy further by allowing more businesses and social activities to resume, the ability to do contact tracing quickly, and at scale, becomes more critical to reduce the risk of new transmission chains forming.

2\. The TraceTogether (TT) Programme – comprising the TT App and the TT Token – provides the initial list of close contacts of COVID-19 positive cases. Together with SafeEntry (SE) and associated digital systems, the TT Programme has enabled the contact tracing teams to reduce the time taken to identify and quarantine a close contact from 4 days to less than 2 days on average. The TT Programme also supplements manual contact tracing by identifying close contacts who are not known to index cases, or cannot be recalled by cases.

## TRACETOGETHER MOBILE BOOTHS  

3\. The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) will be deploying roving TT mobile booths to provide a convenient set-up for the public to adopt the TT Programme. Starting from 2 October 2020, TT mobile booths will be deployed to about 100 locations for public to collect their Tokens, or learn how to download and use the App. The booths will be set up at areas with high footfall such as malls. More details on the schedule and locations of the TT mobile booths can be found in  [Annex A (pdf - 220kb)](/files/press-releases/2020/annex-a-list-of-tt-mobile-booths.pdf).
  
4\. The TT mobile booths are an additional avenue for the public to collect their TT Token for themselves and their family members. For the latest deployment schedule of TT mobile booths, the public can visit the  [TokenGoWhere website](https://token.gowhere.gov.sg/). The website also lists the community centres/clubs (CCs) where the nation-wide distribution of Tokens is taking place.
  
## EXPANSION OF TRACETOGETHER TOKEN COLLECTION POINTS AT COMMUNITY CENTRES/CLUBS

5\. The nation-wide distribution of TT Tokens commenced on 14 September 2020 at CCs in the Jalan Besar and Tanjong Pagar regions. To date, more than 100,000 Tokens have been distributed.

6\. From 1 October 2020, the distribution exercise will be expanded to 18 CCs in the Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Toa Payoh and Sengkang regions. The list of CCs can be found in  [Annex B (pdf - 280kb)](/files/press-releases/2020/annex-b-expansion-of-tt-token-distribution-to-18-ccs.pdf). Residents living outside these areas can also choose to visit the CCs to collect their Tokens early, if they wish.
