_Singapore, 1 February 2021_

On 1 February, the Government will move the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill in Parliament under a Certificate of Urgency.[^1] These amendments will give legal force to the statement made in Parliament by Minister-in-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, and Minister for Home Affairs and for Law, Mr K Shanmugam on 5 January, that the use of TraceTogether (TT) data in criminal investigations would be restricted to serious offences.

## Public Agencies’ Use of Personal Data collected by Digital Contact Tracing Tools

2 The Bill will cover the usage of personal contact tracing data recorded in digital contact tracing systems ("personal contact tracing data"). These systems today comprise TT and SafeEntry (SE), as well as BluePass (BP), insofar as it is interoperable with TT. The TT Programme, which includes the TT App and the TT Token, collects proximity data to help identify close contacts. SE is the national check-in system that is a digital equivalent of visitor record logs. BP is a contact tracing system developed by the private sector that can interoperate with TT.

## Scope of Legislation

3 The legislative amendments will specify that public sector agencies can use personal contact tracing data recorded in digital contact tracing systems only for the purpose of contact tracing, except where there is a need for police officers and law enforcement officers to use the data for criminal investigations and proceedings in respect of serious offences. There are seven categories of “serious offences”, listed in Annex A. These restrictions on the Government’s use of personal contact tracing data will apply regardless of any other written law stating otherwise.

4 The legislation applies to personal contact tracing data, i.e. data which identifies an individual. It does not prohibit de-identified, aggregated or anonymised data recorded in the digital contact tracing systems from being used in epidemiological research to strengthen our public health response, or to monitor the effectiveness of safe management measures implemented by businesses.

5 Once the pandemic is over, the Government will cease the use of the TT and SE systems. Public agencies must then stop collecting such data, and delete the collected personal contact tracing data as soon as practicable.

## Penalties on Unauthorised Access and Use

6 Any public officer (or contractor engaged by a public sector agency) found guilty of unauthorised use or disclosure of personal contact tracing data can be fined up to $20,000, or sentenced to imprisonment for up to 2 years, or both.

## Effective Contact Tracing Essential to Fight COVID-19

7 To date, more than 80% of the population have either downloaded the TT App or collected the TT Token. TT, together with other digital contact tracing tools, has shortened the average time required for contact tracing from 4 days to less than 1.5 days.

8 For contact tracing to be carried out effectively, we continue to require the strong support and active usage of the TT App or Token, to keep ourselves and Singapore safe. The Government is introducing this Bill under extraordinary circumstances. The legislation is intended to remove any doubt about what personal contact tracing data can be used for.

9 We must continue to do well in contact tracing so that we can manage the COVID-19 crisis successfully, ringfence cases quickly, and keep community cases from rising. And we need to make good use of technology and data to help contact tracers do their work quickly and effectively.
