<h2>Factsheet - MyLegacy@LifeSG</h2>
<p><strong>1 March 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><a href="http://mylegacy.life.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyLegacy@LifeSG</a> (“My
Legacy”)was launched in January 2020 to help citizens plan ahead for end-of-life
matters in a seamless way. It integrates and streamlines related services
across multiple government agencies, bringing them onto a single digital
platform. Since its launch, My Legacy has received ~720,000 unique visitors.</p>
<p>My Legacy provides Singaporeans with information and services to plan
for key end- of-life matters such as CPF nomination, Lasting Power of Attorney
(LPA), Advance Care Planning (ACP), and will making. As an example, it
offers an LPA-ACP combined application form which streamlines the processes
for citizens who wish to complete both instruments. Its Vault function
allows citizens to securely store and retrieve personal information, including
bank account details and CPF nomination status. This information can be
shared with their Trusted Persons and accessed when needed, such as when
an individual passes on or becomes mentally incapacitated.</p>
<p>When a loved one passes on, My Legacy is the main government channel for
next-of- kin to download the digital death certificate. It also provides
information on post-death matters such as funeral arrangements and estate
settlement to ease the administrative burden of post-death matters on bereaved
family members. An average of 2,300 digital death certificates[1] are downloaded
from My Legacy every month, with a customer satisfaction score of 4.65
out of 5.</p>
<p>My Legacy will be further enhanced in the upcoming year. We will introduce
new tools and e-services, such as for booking of wake and HDB carpark spaces.
This will support citizens in end-of-life planning, manage post-death matters
for their loved ones, and give bereaved families more time to focus on
other matters in their moment of grief.</p>
