## Leverage new Artificial Intelligence technologies in Government services

**Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore – Second Session for the Sitting on 9 May 2023**

### Question

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Prime Minister** (a) how does the Public Service intend to leverage new artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT in e-Government services; and (b) whether such tools will augment and replace existing chatbot services to provide a better user experience for citizens.

### Answer

**Written answer by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity (for the Prime Minister)**

The Government has integrated AI in digital services such as chatbots on Government websites, the OneService Chatbot for reporting municipal issues through social messaging platforms, and the SG Translate Together web portal.

Recent developments in AI technologies, such as those powering ChatGPT, can help the Government improve the quality of e-services, for example, through better customised responses by chatbots to public queries. We must however, ensure the accuracy and reliability of responses before such service enhancements can be deployed for public use. This will require a period of experimentation and testing.

There are other ways in which the public can benefit from the use of such technologies within Government, for example through more efficient research and analysis of complex issues. The Public Service has therefore introduced guidelines for public officers when using such technologies, to clarify accountability and safeguard data security.
