<h1>Approach of Digital First But Not Digital Only</h1>
<p><strong>Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore – Second Session for the Sitting on 8 May 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye </strong>asked the Minister for Communications
and Information in view of the “digital first but not digital-only” approach
(a) whether the Ministry regularly audits the service journeys provided
by various Ministries and statutory boards to assess their digital inclusion;
(b) whether the Ministry has received any feedback in the past five years
about improving digital inclusion for specific Government agencies; and
(c) if so, whether such feedback has been acted upon.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng </strong>asked the Minister for Communications
and Information how can the policy of “not digital only” be better enforced
in all Ministries and Government-linked agencies to better support residents
who are not digitally able.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p><strong>Oral reply by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Minister-in-Charge of GovTech (for the Prime Minister)</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer PQs 12 and 13 together?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three aspects to being “digital first but not digital-only”.
First, agencies strive to make digital services easy to use. Guided by
the Digital Service Standards (DSS), agencies design and develop digital
services that are (a) accessible and inclusive, (b) usable and (c) relevant.
To supplement agencies’ own usability tests, GovTech helps to identify
areas of improvement for frequently used services. GovTech also provides
central diagnostic tools for agencies to detect usability and accessibility
issues. These, together with feedback from the public, are taken into consideration
when agencies update their digital products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Second, there is a conscious effort to make non-digital alternatives available
to members of the public who are unable to go digital by themselves. For
example, CPF Board and HDB provide in-person and contact centre services
to assist those who have difficulty transacting online. These agency-specific
service centres are complemented by seven physical ServiceSG centres across
Singapore. By housing multiple services under one roof, these ServiceSG
centres simplify and enhance citizen’s experience and better implement
the “not digital only” approach. ServiceSG will continue to expand the
network of centres to prioritise areas with higher demand and concentrations
of citizens, especially seniors. Two more centres will be established at
Woodlands Civic Centre and Bukit Merah town central by the end of 2024
to achieve a wider outreach of citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Third, we persist in helping our people to pick up digital skills and
keep abreast of new developments. For example, IMDA launched the Digital
Skills for Life (DSL) framework in January 2024 to equip Singaporeans with
the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to navigate the digital
space, carry out daily tasks and stay safe online. To better support vulnerable
groups, such as seniors, to learn basic digital skills, the SG Digital
Office has also introduced initiatives such as the Seniors Go Digital programme.
<br>
</p>
<p>These efforts seek to enable all Singaporeans to share in the benefits
of digital developments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
