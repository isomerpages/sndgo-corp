<h1>Breaches of Singpass Facial Verification and Safeguards</h1>
<p><strong>Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore â€“ Second Session for the Sitting on 9 January 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether any
attempts to breach Singpass facial verification have been detected since
it was launched; and (b) what safeguards and measures have been taken to
ensure that Singpass facial verification cannot be breached by deepfakes
or other clones generated by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p><strong>Written answer by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity (for the Prime Minister)</strong>
</p>
<p>Since the launch of facial verification on Singpass, the Government Technology
Agency (GovTech) has not detected breaches. Our agencies continuously monitor,
test and work on improvements. It is best we maintain operational security
over the technical details.</p>
