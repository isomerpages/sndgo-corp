## Using SafeEntry (Business) App to check vaccination status of TraceTogether Token or app users 

**Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore – First Session for the Sitting on 14 September 2021**

### Question

**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Prime Minister** whether the SafeEntry Gateway device can be upgraded to provide an indication of a TraceTogether token or app user’s COVID-19 vaccination status in order to avoid crowding and disputes at access control points.

### Answer

**Written Answer by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity**

Today, businesses can already check the vaccination status of TraceTogether Token or app users by checking against the SafeEntry (Business) App. Once this App is set up on a mobile device, users simply need to tap their TraceTogether Token or app against the device for a fast and convenient way to verify their vaccination status. To redesign the SafeEntry Gateway Box to do the same provides little additional utility, and there are currently no plans to do so.
