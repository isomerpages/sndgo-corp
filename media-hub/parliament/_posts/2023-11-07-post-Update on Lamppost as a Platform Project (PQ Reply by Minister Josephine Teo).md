# Update on Lamppost-as-a-Platform Project 

**Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore – Second Session for the Sitting on 7 November 2023**

### Question

**Mr Yip Hon Weng asked the Prime Minister** (a) whether the Lamppost-as-a-Platform (LaaP) trial on the feasibility of mounting sensors on lamposts has concluded; and (b) if so, whether there are plans for a large-scale rollout of LaaP.

### Answer

**Written answer by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity (for the Prime Minister)**

The Lamppost-as-a-Platform (LaaP) trials were started in late 2017 to explore the technical and business feasibility of using lampposts to mount sensors. Trials were conducted in existing built-up areas in Geylangand One-North, and in a greenfield site at Punggol Northshore. The concept was based on the available technology and information at that point in time, with several other leading
countries similarly exploring this concept.

The technology has evolved since the start of the project, as expected. New and cost-effective options are now available to better meet the varied and dynamic operational needs of our agencies. For example, the use of mobile sensor deployment and fuel cells have brought about greater flexibility and a lower cost as compared to the use of fixed infrastructure like lampposts. Therefore, we have assessed that it is not practical to roll out the LaaP on a large-scale. However, the trial has resulted in positive outcomes, for example the development of data exchange platforms and governance models that allow government agencies to share data from sensors.

Trials are a necessary part of experimenting, learning and developing our processes and skills. The Government will continue to adopt a bold and agile approach for innovative projects that advance Singapore’s smart city ambitions and transform our lived environment. Such an approach allows us to explore new and emerging technologies. We need to be able to scale technology solutions quickly across agencies when validated, or to pivot or discontinue projects and products when appropriate.
