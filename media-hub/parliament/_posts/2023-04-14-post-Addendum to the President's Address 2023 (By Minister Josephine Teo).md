## Addenda to the President's Address at the Opening of the Second Session of the 14th Parliament


**PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (SMART NATION AND DIGITAL GOVERNMENT GROUP)**

**ADDENDUM TO THE PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS**

**Mrs Josephine Teo**

**MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION AND MINISTER-IN-CHARGE OF SMART NATION AND CYBERSECURITY**

The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) aims to harness technology to secure opportunities for all, build trust and safety, and foster an inclusive Singapore community. We work closely with other government agencies to ensure technology bolsters Singapore’s resilience and improves the lives of Singaporeans.

### Securing Technology-Enabled Opportunities for All

Digital technology offers significant opportunities for businesses, people, and government agencies. SNDGG will enable all to seize these benefits through close partnerships with government agencies, industries and research players, and with robust digital and cyber-physical infrastructure anchored by a strong Digital Government.

First, SNDGG will leverage technology to facilitate the business activity, growth, and innovation of Singapore-based enterprises. Together with the Ministry of Trade and Industry, we will enhance the one-stop GoBusiness digital platform to support firms’ day-to-day transactions and longer-term investments, such as in equipping workers with future skills. We will work with the Ministry of Communications and Information to support the digital economy through initiatives like the SG Financial Data Exchange. We will make it easier for businesses to tap on the expertise of public research players for innovation, such as through the JTC-Singapore Institute of Technology Living Lab testbed, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)-Smart Nation and Digital Government Office Jurong Lake District Innovation Challenge.  

Second, SNDGG will use technology to transform the lived experiences of citizens. We will improve the convenience of digital services and transactions through applications such as Singpass and LifeSG. We will also drive advancements in Singapore’s cyber-physical infrastructure with the URA, including scaling innovative solutions in estate management from Punggol Smart Town to other districts. 

Finally, SNDGG will refresh the Digital Government Blueprint in end-2023 and strive towards more discoverable, personalised, and seamless government services. We will work closely with ServiceSG to redesign Whole-of-Government service delivery. This includes promoting the use of common digital platforms across government and building up the government’s data sharing and data usage architecture.

### Building Trust and Safety for our People to Access Technology 

As more of our lives and government services move to the digital space, it is essential to maintain trust in public institutions, and secure the digital platforms hosting these services, so people feel safe and protected against scams. This will set Singapore apart from other world-leading digital hubs. 

First, SNDGG will roll out the CheckWho product in end-2023 to help the public verify the legitimacy of calls from public officers. 

Second, SNDGG will ensure that transactions on government platforms are secure and resilient with tools to better detect phishing sites that pose as government agency websites, and fraud analytics solutions for Singpass. We will also continue to move more eligible government systems to Cloud to improve resilience, security monitoring, and threat detection.   

Finally, SNDGG will work with the community to bolster digital trust and safety. We will support the National Crime Prevention Council and the Singapore Police Force to foster a culture of vigilance and contribution to scam prevention through applications like ScamShield.

### Fostering an Inclusive Singapore Community  

Even as SNDGG aims to enable Singaporeans to reap economic benefits and productivity gains in the digital age, our fundamental aspiration is to build an inclusive, united, and caring society that is “Digital First but not Digital-Only". 
 
Together with ServiceSG, SNDGG will ensure that citizen services offered by public agencies remain accessible for less digitally adept Singaporeans, such as seniors and people with disabilities. Non-digital touchpoints and assistance will be made available to these groups of Singaporeans, wherever possible and necessary. 
 
SNDGG will also empower our people to use digital tools to participate fully in society. We will support efforts by MCI to promote digital skills and literacy in our people, such as the Digital for Life movement led by the Infocomm Media Development Authority, which galvanises the community to help citizens of all ages and from all walks of life embrace lifelong digital learning.  

### Conclusion

Digital technologies will empower Singapore to discover new opportunities and make our mark on the world. With our people, private, and public sector partners, SNDGG is committed to building a Smart Nation where everyone has a place.
