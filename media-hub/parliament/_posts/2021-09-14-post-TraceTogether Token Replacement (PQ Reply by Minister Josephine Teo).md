## Replacement of TraceTogether Tokens and battery lifespan

**Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore â€“ First Session for the Sitting on 14 September 2021**

### Question

**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Prime Minister** (a) to date, how many TraceTogether tokens have been replaced; and (b) what is the average battery lifespan of the tokens.

### Answer

**Written answer by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity (for the Prime Minister)**

As at September 2021, 2.9 million TraceTogether tokens have been replaced. The average battery lifespan is four to six months.

The tokens that have run out of battery may have their batteries changed, or be refurbished. For token models where the battery can be changed, users can get the battery replaced at community centres/ clubs. Tokens that are exchanged for new ones at the vending machines or at the community centres/ clubs will be refurbished.
