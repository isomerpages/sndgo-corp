<h2>Transcript of Speech by Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Tan Kiat How, at the Committee of Supply Debate</h2>
<p><strong>1 March 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, we have made good progress in digitalising our economy. Singapore’s
digital economy generated value-added of $106 billion dollars in 2022 or
about 17 % of our nominal GDP, up from $58 billion or 13% of our GDP in
2017. More enterprises are going digital. For example, more than 9 in 10
enterprises are using e-payment today compared to just 6 in 10 in 2018.
Enterprises are also deploying more advanced digital solutions, such as
cloud computing and data analytics.</p>
<p>Importantly, I am heartened that our SMEs are doing so too. 95% of SMEs
adopted digital solutions in 2023 compared to 74% in 2018. Even hawkers
are coming on board. As of November last year, 60% of our hawkers accept
SGQR digital payments. The platform has facilitated an average of 5.1 million
transactions, or $42 million per month.</p>
<p>IMDA’s programmes like SMEs Go Digital and Hawkers Go Digital have moved
the needle.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pace of technological advancements especially in
AI is picking up pace. We want to equip our enterprises and workers with
the capabilities to ride this new wave.</p>
<p>We are developing a Digital Enterprise Blueprint (DEB) to chart the next
bound of our effort, which Mr Xie Yao Quan asked about.</p>
<p>We have been consulting extensively with sector partners and industry.</p>
<p>We are refining the Blueprint based on their feedback and will put out
a consultation paper in the coming months to seek views from the wider
industry and from the public.</p>
<p>But let me take the opportunity to outline the broad contours of the Blueprint.</p>
<p>The Digital Enterprise Blueprint aims to ‘Uplift our enterprises and workers
in the Age of AI’.</p>
<p>We will do this through 3 thrusts: First, we will empower enterprises
to <strong>Be Smarter</strong> through using AI-powered digital solutions.
Second, we will support our enterprises to <strong>Scale Faster</strong> through
adoption of integrated digital solutions. Third, we will equip enterprises
to <strong>Be Safer</strong> by improving their cyber resilience.</p>
<p>So Smarter, Scale Faster and Safer.</p>
<p>The Digital Enterprise Blueprint is a live document which will be continually
updated. Hence, we have started to implement some ‘no regrets’ moves that
received broad support.</p>
<p>Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Sharael Taha and Mr Mark Lee and others
asked how we are supporting SMEs to benefit from AI.</p>
<p>We will help enterprises and workers access benefits from AI capabilities
through IMDA’s SMEs Go Digital programme.</p>
<p>First, for the vast majority of SMEs, IMDA curates a list of pre-approved
digital solutions suitable for broad based adoption.</p>
<p>We have started working with tech industry to incorporate AI capabilities
in their digital solutions. I am glad to share that as of today, around
20% of these solutions are already AI-enabled.</p>
<p>For example, AI capabilities are integrated seamlessly into customer relationship
management solutions, which can help enterprises analyse customer interactions
and data to suggest constrained marketing campaigns for customers.</p>
<p>In 2023, over 3,000 SMEs have adopted and benefitted from these AI-enabled
pre-approved solutions. So that’s for the broad base of SMEs.</p>
<p>Second, at the sector-level, IMDA has worked with sector leads to co-develop
Industry Digital Plans (IDPs) which serve as roadmaps for enterprises,
highlighting solutions which meet specific needs of the sector.</p>
<p>We started with 5 IDPs in 2018. Today we have 22 IDPs for various sectors,
including sectors like wholesale, construction, retail and food services.
These IDPs cover a broad swathe of our economy.</p>
<p>IMDA will refresh the IDPs to incorporate AI-enabled solutions that would
be relevant to meet the needs of the enterprises in that sector.</p>
<p>We have started doing so in the 4 IDPs that we either launched or refreshed,
namely Legal, Tourism (Attractions), Retail and Security sectors.</p>
<p>One good example is Ghows LLC is a law firm that has been using an AI-enabled
proofreading tool to help check their draft contracts for conflicts and
inconsistencies. I understand from the lawyers that this process used to
be done manually and was tedious, time-consuming and error prone. After
adopting this tool, Ghows saw a 50% productivity improvement and less errors.</p>
<p>We will progressively refresh all IDPs to include sector-specific AI solutions,
so that enterprises can benefit from these useful solutions.</p>
