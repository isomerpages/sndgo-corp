<h2>Transcript of Speech by Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Tan Kiat How, at the Committee of Supply Debate</h2>
<p><strong>1 March 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, we have made good progress in digitalising our economy. Singapore’s
digital economy generated value-added of $106 billion dollars in 2022 or
about 17 % of our nominal GDP, up from $58 billion or 13% of our GDP in
2017. More enterprises are going digital. For example, more than 9 in 10
enterprises are using e-payment today compared to just 6 in 10 in 2018.
Enterprises are also deploying more advanced digital solutions, such as
cloud computing and data analytics.</p>
<p>Importantly, I am heartened that our SMEs are doing so too. 95% of SMEs
adopted digital solutions in 2023 compared to 74% in 2018. Even hawkers
are coming on board. As of November last year, 60% of our hawkers accept
SGQR digital payments. The platform has facilitated an average of 5.1 million
transactions, or $42 million per month.</p>
<p>IMDA’s programmes like SMEs Go Digital and Hawkers Go Digital have moved
the needle.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pace of technological advancements especially in
AI is picking up pace. We want to equip our enterprises and workers with
the capabilities to ride this new wave.</p>
<p>We are developing a Digital Enterprise Blueprint (DEB) to chart the next
bound of our effort, which Mr Xie Yao Quan asked about.</p>
<p>We have been consulting extensively with sector partners and industry.</p>
<p>We are refining the Blueprint based on their feedback and will put out
a consultation paper in the coming months to seek views from the wider
industry and from the public.</p>
<p>But let me take the opportunity to outline the broad contours of the Blueprint.</p>
<p>The Digital Enterprise Blueprint aims to ‘Uplift our enterprises and workers
in the Age of AI’.</p>
<p>We will do this through 3 thrusts: First, we will empower enterprises
to <strong>Be Smarter</strong> through using AI-powered digital solutions.
Second, we will support our enterprises to <strong>Scale Faster</strong> through
adoption of integrated digital solutions. Third, we will equip enterprises
to <strong>Be Safer</strong> by improving their cyber resilience.</p>
<p>So Smarter, Scale Faster and Safer.</p>
<p>The Digital Enterprise Blueprint is a live document which will be continually
updated. Hence, we have started to implement some ‘no regrets’ moves that
received broad support.</p>
<p>Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Sharael Taha and Mr Mark Lee and others
asked how we are supporting SMEs to benefit from AI.</p>
<p>We will help enterprises and workers access benefits from AI capabilities
through IMDA’s SMEs Go Digital programme.</p>
<p>First, for the vast majority of SMEs, IMDA curates a list of pre-approved
digital solutions suitable for broad based adoption.</p>
<p>We have started working with tech industry to incorporate AI capabilities
in their digital solutions. I am glad to share that as of today, around
20% of these solutions are already AI-enabled.</p>
<p>For example, AI capabilities are integrated seamlessly into customer relationship
management solutions, which can help enterprises analyse customer interactions
and data to suggest constrained marketing campaigns for customers.</p>
<p>In 2023, over 3,000 SMEs have adopted and benefitted from these AI-enabled
pre-approved solutions. So that’s for the broad base of SMEs.</p>
<p>Second, at the sector-level, IMDA has worked with sector leads to co-develop
Industry Digital Plans (IDPs) which serve as roadmaps for enterprises,
highlighting solutions which meet specific needs of the sector.</p>
<p>We started with 5 IDPs in 2018. Today we have 22 IDPs for various sectors,
including sectors like wholesale, construction, retail and food services.
These IDPs cover a broad swathe of our economy.</p>
<p>IMDA will refresh the IDPs to incorporate AI-enabled solutions that would
be relevant to meet the needs of the enterprises in that sector.</p>
<p>We have started doing so in the 4 IDPs that we either launched or refreshed,
namely Legal, Tourism (Attractions), Retail and Security sectors.</p>
<p>One good example is Ghows LLC is a law firm that has been using an AI-enabled
proofreading tool to help check their draft contracts for conflicts and
inconsistencies. I understand from the lawyers that this process used to
be done manually and was tedious, time-consuming and error prone. After
adopting this tool, Ghows saw a 50% productivity improvement and less errors.</p>
<p>We will progressively refresh all IDPs to include sector-specific AI solutions,
so that enterprises can benefit from these useful solutions.</p>
<p>Ms Tin asked about CTO-as-a-Service (CTOaaS) platform. Over 92,000 users
have accessed resources from the CTO-as-a-Service platform and over 1,600
SMEs have benefited from the digital consultancy services.</p>
<p>One example is food services company, Xi Men Jie (西门街). The company was
overwhelmed by the numerous tech solutions in the market. The team turned
to a digital consultant under the CTO-as-a-Service scheme for help to integrate
their digital systems. The company achieved 15% in both manpower savings
and sales growth.</p>
<p>I encourage all SMEs to tap on these schemes.</p>
<p>For enterprises who want to do more, we are supporting them through our
Advanced Digital Solutions scheme, which helps bring together the tech
ecosystem to curate solutions for key problems identified by sector leads.</p>
<p>We also launched two new schemes for enterprises to gain experience using
generative AI.</p>
<p>The first is a programme by IMDA and EnterpriseSG to provide a pilot group
of SMEs with access to 13 specially curated generative AI solutions for
common business functions like Marketing and Sales.</p>
<p>If these Gen AI solutions prove useful, we will include them in the SMEs
Go Digital pre-approved list of digital solutions to benefit others.</p>
<p>Now for the second scheme. For larger and more digitally mature enterprises
looking to develop and deploy their own Gen AI digital solutions in their
businesses.</p>
<p>IMDA is launching a new initiative called Generative AI X (pronounced
‘for’) Digital Leaders where tech partners, including tech giants, will
work with participating enterprises to help them develop and implement
innovative generative AI solutions.</p>
<p>We have already seen early interest from enterprises, and we welcome more
to sign up for this initiative.</p>
<p>Let me move on to the second thrust – supporting our enterprises to scale
faster.</p>
<p>In our consultations, SMEs shared that as they started to grow, they realised
that they were constrained by lack of interoperability and scalability
of their digital solutions.</p>
<p>For example, Bread Createur, a food services SME had adopted various sales
channels and delivery platforms over time. However, they found themselves
unable to collate orders automatically and track sales figures across their
third-party delivery platforms and sales channels. What was an inconvenience
for a small operation quickly turned into a showstopper when they grew.</p>
<p>Such stove-piped solutions also prevent enterprises from harnessing the
full potential of digital, including deriving business insights from data
analytics.</p>
<p>We will step up our effort to (a) include more integrated digital solutions
under the SMEs Go Digital programme, (b) stipulate inter-operability requirements
where possible for these solutions, and (c) encourage more of these solutions
to be cloud native for greater scalability.</p>
<p>Where integrated solutions are not available in the market, we will curate
such solutions through the Advanced Digital Solutions scheme.</p>
<p>An example is the Connected Business Suite solution available to Food
Services SMEs. It enabled these SMEs to operate their frontend and backend
functions in an integrated manner.</p>
<p>With this integrated solution, Bread Createur can easily track all their
sales and transactions across different sales channels, including from
third party orders that are routed directly to the kitchen.</p>
<p>At this juncture, I must stress that technology is not the silver bullet,
and integrated and scalable digital solutions would also require the sectors
and enterprises to redesign processes and operations.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will work closely with sector leads and associations
to introduce more pre-approved integrated and cloud-based digital solutions
to support our enterprises to scale quickly as they grow.</p>
<p>Let me move to the third thrust - Be Safer.</p>
<p>I am heartened to see that in CSA’s latest Cybersecurity Survey findings,
75% of</p>
<p>organisations were aware of the importance of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>However, while enterprises are taking steps to improve their cyber hygiene,
there is still much room for improvement.</p>
<p>The same survey found that over 8 in 10 enterprises in Singapore encountered
at least one cybersecurity incident in a year, almost all of them suffered
negative business impacts.</p>
<p>CSA also found that only 1 in 3 organisations implemented more than half
of the 5 categories of cybersecurity measures under CSA’s Cyber Essentials
certification scheme. Lack of knowledge on how to implement cybersecurity
solutions was commonly cited as a challenge.</p>
<p>Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Xie Yao Quan asked how we will help SMEs improve
their cyber resilience. We will flesh this out in the Digital Enterprise
Blueprint. Let me give a broad sense of our three-tier approach.</p>
<p>First, we will support SMEs in taking steps to improve their cyber hygiene.</p>
<p>We will launch a cybersecurity health check tool for enterprises to assess
their cyber hygiene, benchmark themselves against their industry peers
and access resources for them to plug the gaps.</p>
<p>Those who require more support can tap on the Chief Information Security
Officer (CISO)-as-a-Service scheme to engage cybersecurity consultants
to develop tailored cybersecurity health plans.</p>
<p>Enterprises that are eligible can receive co-funding support to defray
the cost for this service. 55 SMEs have benefitted from this scheme thus
far.</p>
<p>Second, we will go upstream and raise the cybersecurity standards of the
digital systems used by our enterprises. This will especially benefit SMEs
with no in-house cybersecurity resources. We will start with the pre-approved
digital solutions under IMDA’s SMEs Go Digital programme.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we will also work with sector-leads to develop industry-specific
guidelines for cybersecurity. In healthcare, for example, CSA worked with
MOH to develop cybersecurity guidelines to improve the security posture
amongst healthcare providers.</p>
<p>We will share more details in the DEB.</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, I have spoken about the three thrusts of the Digital Enterprise
Blueprint to uplift enterprises and workers in the Age of AI by Being Smarter,
Scale Faster and Becoming Safer.</p>
<p>Let me turn to how we are developing tech capabilities within our workforce.</p>
<p>At the broader workforce level, more of us will need to be equipped with
the right skills to effectively use digital tools in our work. With more
rapid technological changes, we need to see reskilling and upskilling as
part of our workplace culture and see this as a continual investment in
ourselves.</p>
<p>Employers must also view the reskilling and upskilling of their employees
as investments so as to fully harness the capabilities of and benefit from
their digital systems. An analogy would be like having a very powerful
car but not being able to go beyond first gear, we need to upskill our
employees so we can make full use of that powerful engine. That is why
each Industry Digital Plan does not only include a suite of curated digital
solutions for enterprises, but also comes with a comprehensive list of
relevant training courses for these digital tools.</p>
<p>For example, the retail IDP includes courses for employees to learn how
to fully use social commerce solutions to generate more sales, including
how to sell items on livestreams.</p>
<p>IMDA has also worked with SkillsFuture Singapore to provide funding support
for many of these courses. I encourage employers and workers to make full
use of these schemes.</p>
<p>Sufficient quality and quantity of tech talent is also crucial to realising
our ambitions.</p>
<p>Understandably, there have been concerns about prospects in the tech sector,
given the layoffs by major technology companies, as raised by Ms Tin Pei
Ling.</p>
<p>Companies across the world have been right siting and right sizing their
operations to prioritise new areas of growth, amid a more challenging economic
climate. Unfortunately, this sometimes results in layoffs which can be
very painful and distressing for those involved.</p>
<p>Singapore is no exception and has similarly seen some layoffs by tech
companies, which have largely impacted those in non-tech roles.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Singapore remains as a key node in many of these tech company’s
global strategies. As they deepen and expand their involvement in the region,
we expect that demand for tech talent in Singapore will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Currently, the demand for tech talent remains strong, with tech jobs across
the economy accounting for a rising share of total employment, from 4.5%
in 2018 to 5.2% in 2023.</p>
<p>This was driven by demand from both the I&amp;C sector and non-I&amp;C
sectors, with the latter accounting for around 57% of tech jobs in 2023.</p>
<p>As more companies adopt digital, including using more advanced digital
solutions like AI, we expect this will also fuel demand for tech talent.</p>
<p>And these are good jobs for Singaporeans – university graduates of information
and digital technologies courses continue to take home the highest median
monthly starting pay at $5,500 per month.</p>
<p>Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Alex Yam and Mr Sharael Taha have
asked about how we will ensure a steady pipeline of tech talent.</p>
<p>Minister Josephine spoke earlier about efforts to develop a pipeline of
AI talent and AI-equipped workers, including efforts to enhance the existing
TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) initiative, which to date has placed more
than 17,000 locals into tech jobs and upskilled and reskilled more than
231,000 professionals.</p>
<p>We are also working hard to strengthen ITE and Polytechnic graduates’
employment outcomes in tech, and provide more development pathways for
them throughout their careers.</p>
<p>IMDA set up the TeSA for ITE and Polytechnics Alliance (TIP Alliance)
in 2022 to bring together like-minded partners – school leadership, tech
industry associations and leading employers of tech manpower like NCS,
Accenture, and ST Engineering, to come together to drive change.</p>
<p>I am heartened that employers are changing their mindset and HR practices.
Instead of just looking at academic qualifications, employers are giving
sufficient weight to the applicants’ skills and capabilities to assess
their suitability.</p>
<p>To push for change across the industry, IMDA and the TIP Alliance launched
the Skills-Based Hiring Movement, together with a handbook providing practical
guidance for firms to attract, assess and develop tech talent based on
competencies.</p>
<p>Within three months, the number of companies pledging their support for
skills-based hiring doubled from 100 to 200.</p>
<p>Oracle is an example of a company that has pledged its support for the
skills- based hiring movement and has been recruiting based on skills for
their openings. As part of their commitment to this approach, their recruitment
team has chosen not to highlight the education requirement in their job
postings for all technical roles in Singapore.</p>
<p>Accenture is another company that has adopted skills-based hiring. They
adopted a rigorous multi-stage assessment focusing on skills, competencies,
and growth potential, which proved to reduce Time-to-Hire by 75%, and increased
quality talent pipelines by 40%.</p>
<p>The skills-based hiring approach aligns with the shifts that we are making
as part of Forward SG to embrace learning beyond grades and create diverse
pathways.</p>
<p>Schools are working to ensure students in tech gain more industry-relevant
experience. For instance, the Information and Digital Technologies (IDT)
schools in our ITE and Polytechnics have lengthened internship durations
from 6 to 12 months.</p>
<p>In 2023, more than 400 Polytechnic and ITE students undertook year-long
internships to gain greater industry experience. We support companies who
provide these year-long internships, by providing co-funding to cover the
cost of training.</p>
<p>Ms Queenie Ng is a beneficiary of this programme. While at Ngee Ann Polytechnic,
she embarked on a year-long internship with OCBC as a full stack developer,
working on dashboards and architecture projects to improve operational
efficiency. Queenie found the scale of the projects to be eye-opening.
In contrast to the smaller scale school projects, the internship exposed
her to more complex systems and their interconnections. This experience
expanded her understanding of the dynamic tech industry and the many exciting
career paths it offers.</p>
<p>人工智能让我们在现有的数码基础上更上一层楼。除了为我们的企业带来新的竞争优势, 也能提高员工的生产力 – 如虎添翼。因此,政府将协助企业,
尤其是中小 企业和员工, 让他们掌握人工智能, 从中获益。</p>
<p>到目前为止, 资媒局已经推出了 22 个产业数码化蓝图。该局接下来在更新蓝图时, 也会加入人工智能的部分。此外, 在中小企业数码化计划下,
资媒局也会在当局预先批准的数码解决方案中, 纳入人工智能技术。如今, 有两成的数码解决方案是由人工智能推动的, 超过 3000 家中小企业已经从中受益。更重要的是,
我们将会和各界合作, 策划相关的培训课程, 协助工友掌握技能, 与时俱进, 把握人工智能所带来的新机遇。</p>
<p>Sir, Singapore does not have the natural advantages of many other economies.
We do not have a sizable domestic market, a large local workforce to tap
on, natural resources but we can well punch above our weight by being agile
and making full use of technological enablers like digital and now AI.</p>
<p>To continue enlarging opportunities for enterprises and creating good
and exciting jobs for Singaporeans, we are building on a very strong foundation
and the government will be a steadfast partner for enterprises and workers
in the next phase of our digitalisation journey to uplift enterprises and
workers in an age of AI. It will be an exciting journey, so I welcome more
likeminded partners to work together with us and invite all enterprises
and workers to join us on this exciting journey ahead. Thank you.</p>
