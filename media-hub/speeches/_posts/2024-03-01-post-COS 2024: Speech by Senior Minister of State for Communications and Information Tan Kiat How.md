<h2>Transcript of Speech by Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Tan Kiat How, at the Committee of Supply Debate</h2>
<p><strong>1 March 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, we have made good progress in digitalising our economy. Singapore’s
digital economy generated value-added of $106 billion dollars in 2022 or
about 17 % of our nominal GDP, up from $58 billion or 13% of our GDP in
2017. More enterprises are going digital. For example, more than 9 in 10
enterprises are using e-payment today compared to just 6 in 10 in 2018.
Enterprises are also deploying more advanced digital solutions, such as
cloud computing and data analytics.</p>
<p>Importantly, I am heartened that our SMEs are doing so too. 95% of SMEs
adopted digital solutions in 2023 compared to 74% in 2018. Even hawkers
are coming on board. As of November last year, 60% of our hawkers accept
SGQR digital payments. The platform has facilitated an average of 5.1 million
transactions, or $42 million per month.</p>
<p>IMDA’s programmes like SMEs Go Digital and Hawkers Go Digital have moved
the needle.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pace of technological advancements especially in
AI is picking up pace. We want to equip our enterprises and workers with
the capabilities to ride this new wave.</p>
<p>We are developing a Digital Enterprise Blueprint (DEB) to chart the next
bound of our effort, which Mr Xie Yao Quan asked about.</p>
<p>We have been consulting extensively with sector partners and industry.</p>
<p>We are refining the Blueprint based on their feedback and will put out
a consultation paper in the coming months to seek views from the wider
industry and from the public.</p>
<p>But let me take the opportunity to outline the broad contours of the Blueprint.</p>
<p>The Digital Enterprise Blueprint aims to ‘Uplift our enterprises and workers
in the Age of AI’.</p>
<p>We will do this through 3 thrusts: First, we will empower enterprises
to <strong>Be Smarter</strong> through using AI-powered digital solutions.
Second, we will support our enterprises to <strong>Scale Faster</strong> through
adoption of integrated digital solutions. Third, we will equip enterprises
to <strong>Be Safer</strong> by improving their cyber resilience.</p>
<p>So Smarter, Scale Faster and Safer.</p>
