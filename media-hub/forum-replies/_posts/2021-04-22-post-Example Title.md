<h2>Forum Reply: Agencies should accept digital IC before year end</h2>
<p>We thank Mr Hefferich Tan for his feedback (<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-digital-ic-still-not-accepted-for-many-services" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital IC still not accepted for many services, April 10</a>).</p>
<p>The digital IC feature in the Singpass app is a secure and convenient
alternative to the physical NRIC.</p>
<p>Government agencies are currently reviewing their processes to accept
the use of the digital IC.</p>
<p>Other than scenarios where physical NRIC or other physical cards are specifically
required by law, agencies should accept the digital IC before the end of
the year.</p>
<p>We also encourage all businesses to follow the Government's lead and accept
the digital IC.</p>
<p>If possible, they should digitalise their processes, and review whether
the physical identification card is needed in the first place.</p>
<p>We appreciate the public's patience and understanding.</p>
