# SafeEntry Check-Out Could Improve Efficacy of Contact Tracing
## Lianhe Zaobao - 24 June

 
We thank Ms Chen Yi An (TraceTogether Token should record time of exit, 17 June), Mr Su Ying Quan (Room for improvement for TraceTogether system, 19 June) and Ms Luo Zi Fen (TraceTogether Token should allow for check-in and check-out, 19 June), for their feedback.
 
TraceTogether (TT) and SafeEntry (SE) are digital tools that have been rolled out quickly to support our contacting tracing efforts in the fight against COVID-19. These tools are being enhanced along the way, as we respond to changing public health needs. 
 
Currently, TT app users who scan the venue’s QR code account for more than half of all SE check-ins. These users can complete their check-out by using the TT App, and view their SE check-in/out records in the App.
 
Starting this week, SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) Check-Out Boxes will be progressively rolled out at venues with higher throughput of visitors (e.g. malls, hospitals and polyclinics); and at places where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods with masks off (e.g. dine-in F&B outlets and gyms). This will allow Token users and TT App users who have checked-in via the SEGW Box to do their check-outs. Venues who have set up the SafeEntry (Business) App can also check out their visitors by using the App’s “check-out” feature.
 
The check-out information will aid contact tracing efforts by allowing our contact tracers to access more granular data quickly. Currently, if contact tracing is required and SE check-out data is not available, contact tracers will use other sources of information, including via interview, to check and verify the patient’s duration of stay at a particular venue. This means more time and manpower needed for the contact tracing.
 
Therefore, with the deployment of SEGW Check-Out Boxes, we encourage members of the public to check out whenever possible. The SEGW Check-Out Box looks like the existing Check-In Box commonly seen at public venues, with a blue sticker to identify it as the Check-Out Box. 
 
Mr Su asked about SE implementation at malls. SE check-in will be required so long as one is entering the mall. Whether within or outside of the mall’s operating hours, SE check-in is not needed for takeaway at F&B outlets with no dine-in options as people are unlikely to be in these venues for a long time.
 
We will continue to improve the user experience of the TT Programme and SE, and adjust our approach to enable effective contact tracing even as the public health situation evolves.
