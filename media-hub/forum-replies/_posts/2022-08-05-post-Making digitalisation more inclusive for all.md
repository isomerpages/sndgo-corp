## Forum Reply: A multi-pronged approach to make digital more inclusive


We refer to recent forum letters and the Zaobao editor’s notes on 22 and 27 July on the impact of digitalisation on seniors. We agree we need to strike a balance between digitalisation, and being inclusive to all segments of society. This has always been our approach in bringing the benefits of technology to as many as possible, including seniors.

Digitalisation has made government services more accessible, convenient and safe. This has brought benefits to many seniors, including those who are less mobile. To support Singaporeans in using digital services, we have invested in digital readiness programmes such as Seniors Go Digital, providing one-on-one training to more than 150,000 seniors in basic digital skills such as making e-payments. Seniors requiring help to use digital services may visit the SG Digital community hubs in libraries and community centres across Singapore to get one-on-one guidance. The ServiceSG Centres islandwide also offer assistance to access frequently used Government services and schemes across 20 agencies.

However, there will be some who face continued difficulties such as those raised by Mr Gao Ji Deng (Payment issues faced by the elderly, 22 July) and Ms Shen Wenfeng (Do not neglect the needs of seniors, 3 August). We will continue to assist users who need help accessing such services. For instance, while we aim to move towards a cheque-free society by 2025, due to declining cheque volume and increased use of e-payments, cash will continue to be accepted as a familiar and convenient way to transact. Cashier’s orders would also remain as an alternative to cheques.

We also want to work with partners to further digital inclusion, including those from the public, private and people sectors. Through the Digital for Life movement, more than 100 partners have stepped forward with ground-up initiatives that have enriched the lives of some 200,000 Singaporeans.

We are encouraged by efforts of many seniors who have embraced technology, and urge families and friends to continue to support them in this journey. The Government will continue to work with partners to play its part, and make digitalisation more inclusive for all.
