# Climbing To The Top Spot 

[Eden Strategy Institute](https://www.edenstrategyinstitute.com/) and ONG&ONG has put together a biennial study that rates Smart City Governments across the world. The study focuses on the role of city governments and how they drive their own smart city initiatives. 

In this 2nd edition, Singapore has taken the top honours out of over 230 cities that were evaluated by Eden Strategy Institute. Seoul and London took the 2nd and 3rd spots respectively, and with the third Asian city – Shanghai – in the Top 10 at #8. 

The Top 50 Smart City Government rankings are based on the documents that are submitted by the cities based on Eden’s Call for Proposals. This information supplements their secondary research into the list of cities – allowing the judging panel to have a full understanding of each city’s plans and actions. The ranking is based on the following ten key factors: 

* **Vision** - A clear and well-defined strategy to develop a “smart city” 
* **Leadership** - Dedicated City leadership that steers smart city projects 
* **Budget** - Sufficient funding for smart city projects 
* **Financial**- Financial incentives to effectively encourage private sector participation (e.g. grants, rebates, subsidies, competitions) 
* **Support Programmes** - In-kind programmes to encourage private actors to participate (e.g. incubators, events, networks) 
* **Policies** - A conducive policy environment for smart city development (e.g. data governance, IP protection, urban design) 
* **Ecosystems** - A comprehensive range of engaged stakeholders to sustain innovation 
* **People-Centricity** - A sincere, people-first design of the future city 
* **Talent-Readiness** - Programmes to equip the city’s talent with smart skills 
* **Track Record** - The government’s experience in catalysing successful smart city initiatives
