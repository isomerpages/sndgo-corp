Singapore has topped the IMD-SUTD Smart City Index again for 2020. The Index was launched in 2019 and is based on citizens' perception of how their city's technological advances have impacted their lives. 

Institute for Management Development (IMD) surveyed citizens from 109 cities in April and May 2020 with questions on five key areas â€“ health and safety, mobility, activities, opportunities and governance. This year's ranking also took into account how the cities managed the COVID-19 pandemic with technology.
