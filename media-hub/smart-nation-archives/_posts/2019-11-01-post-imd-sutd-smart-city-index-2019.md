For the first time, the Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Competitive Centre’s Smart City Observatory and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) has launched the first edition of the IMD Smart City Index 2019. Singapore has taken the top spot, with Zurich and Oslo rounding out the top three. 

The IMD Smart City Index 2019 is the first of its kind and focuses on how the countries’ citizens perceive their own cities. In the first edition, 102 cities worldwide were rank by surveying 120 residents per city on five key areas:
* Health and Safety
* Mobility
* Activities
* Opportunities 
* Governance 

Being recognised globally as a *Smart City* shows that our investments into our Smart Nation initiative is paying off. It allows us to shine on the international stage to attract more investments to our little red dot – which will help us grow further and faster.
