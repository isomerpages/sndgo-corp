Pitch your creative ideas! Re-imagine how digital technologies and data from the bank and government perspectives can help improve the lives of all Singaporeans, making our Smart Nation an even better one to live, work and play in. Jointly organised by DBS, GovTech and SUTD, the Smart City Challenge provides the opportunity for you to learn digital design techniques through learning labs and mentorship programmes, and apply these techniques in real world use cases. Registration closes on 15 Feb 2019!
