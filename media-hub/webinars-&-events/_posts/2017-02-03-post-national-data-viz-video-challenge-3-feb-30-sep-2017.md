How can open data help improve daily decision-making or quality of lives for your loved ones? Participants of the inaugural National Data Viz Video Challenge will use at least one government dataset from any Singapore government open data portal, preferably cross-analyse with other reliable publicly available data sources, and create an impactful visualisation video submission to illustrate the benefits of open data. Voting begins in September, and the Challenge Round Judging and Prize Giving Ceremony will take place in late September!
