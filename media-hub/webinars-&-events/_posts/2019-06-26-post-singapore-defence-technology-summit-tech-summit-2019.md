*Event Details*<br>		
A unique gathering of global thought leaders from defence, security establishments, industry, academia and think tanks to network, confer and collaborate in the development of defence and security capabilities. Building on the insights gained from the inaugural event last year, Tech Summit 2019 will examine domains such as artificial intelligence, sensors and drones pioneered by the military but rapidly adopted for commercial use, and discuss how these developments will impact defence, security and society. Discussion will also explore how breakthroughs in neuroengineering, synthetic biology and space will shape our future, and more.
