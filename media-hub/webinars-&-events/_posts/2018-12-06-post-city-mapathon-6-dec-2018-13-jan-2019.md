*Event Details*<br>		
Hit the streets to capture images that help us map our city and stand a chance to win attractive prizes! Join us on this community-driven geospatial challenge co-organised by GeoWorks and Mapillary. The challenge seeks to encourage citizenry participation in helping to acquire map data by capturing street-level images of our city. These data will provide the basis for mapping and geospatial analytics which can improve the liveability, accessibility and mobility for our city, such as planning and design of barrier-free routing for people with disabilities, wider shared paths for pedestrians and PMD users, amenities along Park Connector networks that promotes green mobility and many more.
