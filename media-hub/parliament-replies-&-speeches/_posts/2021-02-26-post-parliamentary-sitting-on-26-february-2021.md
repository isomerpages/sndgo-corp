# Fourteenth Parliament Of Singapore â€“ First Session For The Sitting On 26 February 2021

## Written Answer by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security

1.  A range of private and public sector service providers are involved in post-death administrative matters. The Ministry of Health, Public Service Division and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group launched the My Legacy portal in January 2020. The portal, currently in beta testing, aims to be a one-stop platform for end-of-life, palliative care and post-death matters, and to make planning easy and convenient. This is part of the LifeSG initiative to integrate and bundle Government and private sector services, to help citizens access services and information that are relevant to them.

2.  The portal has a My Legacy Vault feature that allows users to plan, store and share legal, healthcare and estate matters securely with the people they trust. This includes storing of financial information such as CPF nomination status, bank account details, insurance policies, and legal documents such as Lasting Power of Attorney. Users can designate trusted persons such as family members to access these documents, with the option to also allow access before death has occurred, to facilitate post-death administration matters.
