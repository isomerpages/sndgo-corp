# Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore – First Session for the Sitting on 13 September 2021

## Written Answer by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity

1. Businesses can use the SafeEntry (Business) App to check on the vaccination and test status of their visitors. Members of the public can use either their TT App or Token to tap against the mobile device uploaded with the SafeEntry (Business) App, for the business to verify their status from the display.
2. More than 70% of the businesses that need to implement vaccinated-differentiated SMMs have already set up the SafeEntry (Business) App. For those that have not done so, we have published a step-by-step guide on the SafeEntry website. Businesses that require further help can approach Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Smart Nation Ambassadors to provide hands-on assistance. Businesses may also submit a ticket on the SafeEntry website for technical support or call the SafeEntry Gateway hotline. We will continue to render help to businesses and other organisations as needed.
